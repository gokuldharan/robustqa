          "context": "New Orleans, Louisiana, 1927. An angry post of men descends on the isolated Seven Doors Hotel deep in the swamps. They grab onto an artist named Schweik (Antoine Saint John), who is trapped there. Accusing him of being a warrior, Schweik is dragged to the basement where he is brutally beaten with heavy chains, tortured with quick lime acid, and crucified with his wrists nailed to a basement wall, despite his stern warnings that evil is unleashed. New Orleans, 1981. Liza Merril (Catriona MacColl) is a young woman who arrives from New York City to claim the hotel as her heritage. Architect friend Marin Avery (Michele Mirabella) started showing her in the area earlier, strange incidents started happening. A painter (Anthony Flees) falls off his rig and is terribly injured, he coughs up blood and chats about 'the eyes, the eyes'. Dr. John McCabe (David Warbeck) arrives to take the injured man to the hospital and offers Liza sympathy. Next, a plumber named Joe tries to repair a large leak in the flooded basement. However, he is killed by a presence that appeared behind a slender wall. The atmosphere at the hotel is further cooled by the whimsical servants, Arthur (Giampaolo Saccarola) and Martha (Veronica Lazar), who apparently come with the hotel. Martha discovers Joe's body in the basement, and another much older corpse lying in a pool of dirty water nearby. It's apparently that of Schweik, the artist. Liza drives down the 14-mile highway to New Orleans and meets a strange blind woman standing in the middle of the deserted highway. The blind woman introduces herself as Emily (Sarah Keller) and tells Liza that she has been waiting for her, even though her eyes are closed with cataracts. Liza drives Emily to her lavishly furnished home in New Orleans. Liza is warned by Emily to leave the hotel while she can still. Meanwhile, Dr John McCabe performs the autopsy on the hospital's plumber, while his assistant Harris (Al Cliver) wants to install an EMG machine in Schweik's body. John laughs it off and leaves for lunch, while Harris stays behind to install the EMG machine. After Harris leaves for a call, the EMG machine starts pulse of activity. A while later, Joe's wife Mary-Anne (Laura De Marchi) arrives with her daughter Jill (Maria Pia Marsale) to dress her husband's body for the funeral, when she is horribly murdered by having acid burn. Jill is then threatened by Schweik's animated corpse. Liza meets with John McCabe in a downtown bar to discuss her concerns and concerns. He expresses surprise when Lisa complains about the clumsiness of her strange servants. John claims he has never heard of them, even though he knew everyone in the area. Then comes a phone call from Harris' bar informing John that Mary-Anne's body was found in the morgue, while Jill was found terrified in a corner and unable to speak. After the funeral of Joe and Mary-Anne, Emily reappears in the hotel to Liza that evening. Emily tells Liza about the warlock Schweik, who stayed in room 36 of the hotel and about the supernatural underworld that hides the hotel. The hotel was built over one of the seven gates of hell, and Schweik was the guardian. Emily is about to reveal more as her hands wander to a canvas depicting a deserted vision of lost souls in a horrible and arid landscape. Suddenly scared, Emily says that the painting was painted by Schweik before he died, and she runs out of the hotel room at night. But Liza notices a disturbing fact about her sudden departure: Emily makes no footfall on the bare wooden planks as she runs, and neither does her sighted eye dog. The next day, Liza nervously ventures into room 36, a sloppy fantasy of sheet-covered furniture and dusty fabric. She finds an old book whose strange fleshy cover bears the single word",

          "context": "In ancient times, England was in turmoil. With the death of the King, no one can decide who is the rightful heir to the throne. With war threatening to tear the country apart, a stone and anvil appeared from the sky in the city of London, with a sword firmly planted in the anvil. Read the words on the stab of the sword: \"Whoever draws this sword from this stone, and the anvil is rightly king, born of England.\" Many try to draw the sword, but no one can bounce it. In time, the sword is forgotten, and the dark ages plunge the countryside into a gloomy state. One day in the woods, Sir Kaye is out hunting with his adopted brother Arthur, whom everyone calls 'wart'. After missing Kaye for shooting a deer, Arthur promises to fetch the arrow. Arthur's journey leads him to a small hut in which a wizard named Merlin and his pet owl, Archimedes, live who can speak. Merlin explains to Arthur that he expected him to appear. After drinking tea, Merlin decides to accompany Arthur back to his house, and after packing everything in the hut in a small suitcase, the two leave. Arthur and Merlin arrive at Sir Ector's castle, where Arthur is immediately put to work in the kitchen. Merlin introduces himself to Ector, and shows his powers to the doubting Knight. After some persuasion, Ector allows Merlin to stay and puts him in the Northwest Tower, a crumbling building of the castle. A few days later Archimedes notices the arrival of Sir Pelinore, who brought news from London of a tournament to Ector and Kaye. According to the rules, the winner of the tournament becomes the new king of England. Ector starts eagerly getting Kaye to practice, promising in his excitement for Arthur that if he keeps working hard on his duties, he can become Kaye's penguin. Merlin hears of this news and decides to push Arthur to see his true potential (since Merlin can move into the past and the future, he knows who Arthur is going to become). As he walks outside next to the castle moat, Merlin explains that he can turn into a fish. This idea excites Arthur, and Merline turns them both into fish to explore the moat. However, a much larger fish soon gives way to the young Arthur, until they both manage to escape. Arthur's inertia in helping Kaye practice leads to him washing dishes. Merlin finds him, and after enchanting the dishes and accessories, he leads Arthur into the forest, where both are turned into squirrels by the wizard. As Arthur jumps through the trees, he comes across a girl squirrel, who soon loves him. Merlin finds the whole scenario cute until he is soon found irresistible by another squirrel. Merlin then changes himself and Arthur back to normal. The girl squirrel who was in love with Arthur shone away, sad. Arthur and Merlin return to the castle, where Ector Merlin lectures to make Arthur relinquish his duties. Arthur tries to defend Merlin, but his 'mouth' ends with Ector declaring that Arthur will not become Kaye's shooter, and that the honor will belong to another person from the castle, named Hobbes. Arthur is reported on what happened, but Merlin tries to keep him going and plans to educate Arthur. While trying to explain things, Archimedes intervenes in Merlin's teaching methods, as Merlin educates Arthur about things that will not be proven for hundreds of years, and which may well make people think of Arthur as a wonderful fool in their present dark ages. Upset about this lecture, Merlin hands over teaching duties to Archimedes while fiddling with a model plane. Archimedes mocks the toy plane, while Merlin tries to prove that 'man will fly'. His efforts cause the plane to fall like a rock to the moat. Although the flight of the plane failed, Arthur recounts how he dreamed of soaring like a bird. It is then that Merlin uses his",

Because he believes that Brink is an ordinary stranger, the old Gramps commands Mr. Brink the property. Pud comes out of the house and asks who the stranger was. Gramps was amazed and relieved that someone else could see the stranger; he was not merely a dream or appearance. Pud tells Gramps that when he does a good deed, he will be able to make a wish. Because his apples are constantly being stolen, Gramps wishes that anyone who climbs his apple tree should stay there until he allows them to climb down. Pud accidentally tests the wish if he struggles to get off the tree himself, and only becomes free when Gramps says he can. Pud's busy aunt Demetria (Eily Malyon) has designs on Pud and the money his parents left behind. Gramps spends a lot of time fending off her attempts to adopt the boy. Brink takes Grandma Nellie (Beulah Bondi) to a peaceful death just after completing some knitting. When Mr. Brink returning to Gramps, the old man finally realizes who his visitor is. Because he is determined not to leave Pud to Demetria, Gramps misleads Mr. Brink to climb the apple tree. While stuck in the tree, he can not take Gramps or anyone else. The only way anyone or anything can die is if they mr. Brink or touch the apple tree. Demetria plans to have Gramps committed at a psychiatric hospital when he claims death was trapped in his apple tree. Gramps first proves his story by proving that his doctor, Dr. Evans (Henry Travers), can't even kill a fly they caught. He offers further proof of his power by mr. To shoot Grimes (Nat Pendleton), the ordinance who came to take him to the asylum; Grimes was alive when he had to die. Dr. Evans is now a believer, but he tries to convince Gramps to let go of death so that suffering people can find release. Gramps refuses, so the doctor sees to it that the local sheriff commits Gramps while Pud is delivered in custody of Demetria. With the help of his housekeeper (Una Merkel), Gramps deceives them into believing that they, along with Mr. Brink would go if he came down from the tree. They beg Gramps to convince Brink otherwise, and Demetria promises never to bother Gramps or Pud again. Gramps realizes that sooner or later he will have to let Brinks down - Death is ultimately an inevitable part of life. He tries to say goodbye to Pud, who reacts angrily and tries to run away. Mr Brink sees Pud in the garden and dares to climb the tree. Pud comes across the fence that Gramps had built around the tree, but falls and is paralyzed for life. Upset, Gramps drops the tree. He takes both Gramps and Pud, who find that they can walk again. In the last scene, they walk together on a beautiful country track and hear Grandma Nellie calling to them from outside a brilliant light. ",

      "paragraphs": [
        {
          "context": "A Huey helicopter flies over the Alaska Wilderness, and its pilots search for someone below. That someone, Major Mitchell Gant USAF (Rtd) (Clint Eastwood), hears the helicopter approaching and immediately breaks back in a dead run to his cabin, where he pulls a gun from his rack and hooks it up. As the helicopter lands, Gant falls into a post-traumatic recollection of a nightmare he lived in Vietnam: in his A-4 shot down over the North, he is taken to a prison camp when two Hueys shoot his prisoners. . Gant suffered personal trauma when a flying A-4 set fire to the site, killing a girl who had been standing around for too long and watching the blow. Back in the present, Captain Arthur Buckholz (David Huffman) takes Gant out of his episode and apologizes for the surprise. The following few scenes are back-and-forth between the conversation between Gant and Buckholz, and an information session conducted by Kenneth Aubrey (Freddie Jones) of the British SIS on the latest fighter / interceptor of the Soviet Union: the Mikoyan-Gurevich \"MiG\" \"Model 31, codenamed\" Firefox \"by NATO. Its capabilities are unlike any other in the world: total stealth, twin engines each delivering 50,000 pounds, a battle ceiling of over 100,000 feet, faster than Mach 5 or even Mach 6 (and capable of maintaining it, no small feat not) and a weapon and the defense system that can read the mind of the pilot and allow him to aim and fire his weapons without having to press a button first, thus giving a reaction time advantage of 3 to 5 seconds on any opponent. NATO's decision is to send Gant in to steal a Soviet development base Firefox prototype in Bilyarsk near the Ural Mountains. Gant resents him over the operation because he is simply blackmailed; he was allowed to live on government land that would now be sold out under him if he did not agree to the mission. The NATO Air Force supporter (Thomas Hill) is also indignant because Gant has no experience as a spy, and worse, he is subject to post-traumatic stress disorder and can crack at any time. They use Gant only for two reasons: he speaks fluent Russian and adapts the pressure suit that the MiG-31's main test pilot, lt. Col. Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff). Gant undergoes several weeks of retraining, both in flying and in air combat, and information about his first required imitation - as a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague, known for smuggling heroin into the Soviet Union. After completing his training, he is sent to London, where Aubrey gives him his final briefing on his goals, and he is disguised with a new hairstyle and a fake mustache. Gant is also familiar with the underground networking group, which is mostly Russian Jews. Aubrey also gives him a one-way tracking device disguised as a cheap transistor radio. What his handlers do not tell him, however, is that Gant will remain on his own if something jeopardizes the compromise. Gant lands at the Sheremetyevo airport in Moscow, blows through an unannounced customs search and manages to leave the airport - with the 'radio'. He takes a taxi to his rooms in the Hotel Moscow, puts the radio in his pocket and waits. Outside, he sees three Soviet soldiers walking goose while patrolling. Meanwhile, in the KGB Moscow Center on Dzherzhinskiy Square, Colonel Kontarsky (Kenneth Colley) of the KGB finalized his plans to protect the MiG-31 before being tried the next day for the Soviet First Secretary word. He also ordered his second commander, Dmitri Priabin (Oliver Cotton), to arrest some underground members at dawn, but not to withdraw before that time. Kontarsky actually knows all about the spy network that is pushing information from Bilyarsk out of Russia - but even he does not know what the CIA and the SIS really planned. That evening, Gant walks out to the Krasnokholmskiy Bridge, under instructions to be there at exactly 10:30 while the KGB puts him in the shade - he is ordered",

          "context": "On a short trip back to London, the serious, bookish bacteriologist Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is blinded by Kitty Garstin (Naomi Watts), a vibrant and vain London company. He suggests; she accepts (\"just to get as far away from [her] mother\" as possible \"), and the couple's honeymoon in Venice. They travel further to Walter's medical post in Shanghai, where he is stationed in a government laboratory to study infectious diseases. They do not find themselves suitable, with Kitty much more interested in parties and the social life of the British expatriates. Kitty meets Charles Townsend (Liev Schreiber), a married British vice-consul, and the two are in a secret relationship. When Walter discovers his wife's infidelity, he wants to punish her by threatening to divorce her on the grounds of adultery, if she does not accompany him to a small town in a remote area of China. He voluntarily treated the victims of an uncontrolled cholera epidemic that washes through the area. Kitty begs to be allowed to quietly separate from him, but he refuses and says, \"Why should I do myself the slightest trouble for you?\" She hopes Townsend will leave his wife Dorothy and marry her. When she presents Charles with this possibility, he refuses to accept it, even though he has previously claimed that he likes Kitty. She is obliged to travel with her husband to the mountainous inland region. They undertake a difficult two-week land trip, which would be significantly faster and much easier if they traveled by river, but Walter is determined to make Kitty as unhappy and uncomfortable as possible. Upon their arrival in Mei-tan-fu, she is saddened to discover that they will be living in a bad neighborhood, far removed from everyone except their cheerful neighbor Waddington, a British deputy commissioner who is in a relative luxury at ' a young Chinese woman lives. Walter and Kitty barely talk to each other and except for a cook and a Chinese soldier who has to look after her, she is alone for long hours. After a visit to an orphanage run by a group of French nuns, Kitty volunteered for her services and was assigned to work in the music room. She is surprised to learn from the Mother Superior that her husband loves children, especially babies. In this environment she begins to see him in a new light as she learns what a selfless and caring person he can be. When he sees her with the children, he realizes that she is not the shallow, selfish person he thought she was. As Walter's anger and Kitty's unhappiness diminish, their marriage begins to blossom in the midst of the epidemic crisis. She soon finds out she is pregnant, but is not sure who the father is. Walter - in love with Kitty again - assures her that it does not matter. The cholera epidemic is taking many victims. As Walter and the locals begin to control it, entirely due to its import of clean water through a system of aqueducts (since the locals do not understand waterborne infectious diseases [2] [need better source]), it carries cholera refugees from elsewhere the area flows in and forces Walter to set up a camp outside the town. He gets the disease and Kitty nurses him lovingly, but he dies, and she is crushed. Pregnant and pregnant, she leaves China. Five years later, Kitty looks well dressed and happy in the shop with her young son Walter in London. They meet Townsend by chance on the street, and he suggests that Kitty meet him. When he asks the young Walter at his age, he realizes from the answer that he may have been the son of the boy. Kitty rejects his overtures and walks away. When her son asks who Townsend is, she replies 'Nobody matters, honey'. ",

          "context": "Police are investigating a series of robberies along a strip of land in the city. The new mayor of the city (Kenneth Mars) knows Captain Harris (G.W. Bailey) and lt. Proctor (Lance Kinsey) on the case, but the Wilson gang manages to slip through their fingers. The mayor wants Harris and Proctor to work with Commander Lassard (George Gaynes), police chief, to apprehend the gang. Lassard puts together a team of seven men consisting of Hightower (Bubba Smith), Tackleberry (David Graf), Jones (Michael Winslow), Hooks (Marion Ramsey), Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), Fackler (Bruce Mahler) and Lassard's cousin, Nick (Matt McCoy) who leaves Miami (in the previous film Police Acdemy 5) for the city to stay close to his friends and dull uncle. After distributing flyers about the information of the Wilson gang and getting nowhere, Nick McCoy stumbles upon a piece of paper heading from an antique diamond heading to a museum, and gets an idea to use it as bait use: however, the robbers grab the diamond anyway by cutting a hole in the truck that escapes through the sewer system. McCoy then decides to go into secrets to get information about a possible hideout, but Harris decides to get a secret confession. It turns out that Harris is hiding as a window washer at a tall building, which he fears for heights, and gets a confession of himself on tape after his loyal but insensitive skull, Proctor, accidentally hits him across the balcony. . Here it is revealed that the robberies are committed by a group of three cunning criminals who apparently cannot do it on their own, and it is revealed that they are led by a literal shadow figure, known as the 'Mastermind'. ', talking to the three behind a glass wall and using a voice distortion device. He devises a plan to eliminate the police. Commandant Lassard and his men are later suspended after stolen jewelery from the last robbery was planted in Lassard's locker, pending an investigation. The police, who fit in incorrectly, decide to clear Lassard's name by pinning the gang and the main leader. With access to data files from a computer, McCoy deduces that the robberies are taking place along a bus route, thereby deliberately lowering property values in that part of the city. They also hear that someone has to 'leak' information to the bad guys, which is why they are always one step ahead of the Police Academy. The police academy finds a fight with the Wilson gang, while Nick pursues the leader. A pursuit ensues, leading to the office of Commissioner Hurst (George Robertson). It is revealed that the mayor is the \"brain\" and that Captain Harris unknowingly leaked information during his daily meetings with the mayor. Hurst apologizes and restores power, and a memorial plaque is given to honor the officers' bravery the next day. As the film closes, Harris sits in a chair when a string is tied that fastens the balloon float, lifts his chair and drives him into the air as he shouts Proctor's name. ",

          "context": "The film starts a few years in the future from this exact moment. We see ads everywhere (buildings, walls, bus stops, etc.) for the hit game Slayers, and how the strong character Kable (Gerard Butler) has four fights left before earning his freedom. We are then shown an ongoing battle: a massive shooting inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters get points for each kill and for rescuing a teammate. It is shown that some characters do bad tasks on the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17-year-old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays / controls Cable and guides him through the factory. After slaughtering most of his way, Kable is blown out of the factory. Cable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Thereafter, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, as he now has only three fights left until freedom. Some of the other characters do not believe that anyone will be released from the game. The producer (Michael Weston) and chief of staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next guest for the show - the ingenious vault Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game, but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a real person and can make them do what they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can be paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago, Castle Slayers created a controversial game backed by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by saying that all the characters in the game, although they are real people, are all prisoners on the underworld who prefer to sign up for the game instead of serving their prison sentences. If a prisoner can stay alive for thirty battles, they will be released (though no one has survived that long). Some prisoners are sent to battlefields with pre-arranged actions to do, and will be released if they survive only one battle but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death toll extremely high). The games are also all broadcast on pay-per-view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nanocells implanted in their brains, making it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled within the perimeter of the game (meaning that after the game is over, they regain control). After the show, the signal is hacked by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and declares that we will all eventually be his slaves if we drive on. Castle gets a kick out of it and lets his men try to track down where the signal is coming from. In prison, a convict kills a guard and tries to escape, but in the end he does not succeed. Cable sits alone and thinks of his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Cable. He talks about how Kable mocks everyone when he sits alone and constantly thinks. He can not believe that Cable has only three fights left. Freek asks him why he's in jail. Cables have a quick flashback of a man bleeding into a room. Later, while sitting in his cell, someone opens the slot of the door and gives Kable a photo of his wife and child. The female voice on the other hand knows that his family is the only thing he is fighting for. She has Cable sign a signature for her son, David, and then takes a blood sample from his hand as proof of authenticity to increase the value of the signature. Elsewhere we see Kable's wife Angie (Amber Valletta) going to work as a character in the Society. Virtually all the game characters are dressed in ridiculous and skinny costumes",

          "context": "Early one morning a taxi drives by Tiffany & amp; Co. in Fifth Avenue in New York City, from which elegantly dressed Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) emerges. After looking in the shop windows, she walks home. Outside her apartment, she fends off Sid Arbuck (Claude Stroud), her appointment from the disastrous night before. Later, she is awakened by the new neighbor Paul Varjak (George Peppard) and rings her doorbell to enter the building. The couple chats as she dresses to leave after her weekly visit to Sally Tomato (Alan Reed), a master incarcerated in Sing Sing Prison. Tomato's lawyer, O'Shaughnessy, pays her $ 100 a week to deliver 'the weather report'. Audrey Hepburn as Holly Golightly\nAs she leaves for Sing Sing, Holly is introduced to Paul's 'decorator', the wealthy older woman Emily Eustace Failenson (Patricia Neal), whom Paul calls '2E'. That night, Holly goes out to the fire escape to avoid an overzealous date (Mel Blanc). She peeks into Paul's apartment and sees 2E money left behind and kissing Paul goodbye. After 2E leaves, Holly enters Paul's apartment and learns that he is a writer who has not had anything published since five years before. Holly in turn explains that she is trying to save money to support her brother Fred when he comes out of the military. The couple falls asleep, but wakes up when Holly has a nightmare about Fred. She later buys Paul a ribbon for the typewriter to apologize and invites him to a party at her apartment. There, Paul meets her Hollywood agent, O. J. Berman (Martin Balsam), who describes Holly's transformation of country girl into Manhattan social. He is also introduced to José Silva Pereira (José Luis de Vilallonga), a wealthy Brazilian politician, and Rusty Trawler (Stanley Adams), the 'ninth richest man in America under 50'. In the days that follow, Paul and Holly get closer. One day, 2E enters Paul's apartment, worried she's being followed. Paul tells her that he is going to investigate and eventually confronts Doc Golightly (Buddy Ebsen), Holly's estranged husband. Doc explains that Holly's real name is Lula Mae Barnes. They were married when she was 13, and he wants to take her back to Texas because Fred will return. After Paul reunites Holly and Doc, she tells Paul that the marriage has been annulled. At the bus station she tells Doc she is not going with him. Dock leaves broken of heart. After drinking at a club, Paul and Holly return to her apartment, where she tells him drunk that she plans to marry Trawler for his money. A few days later, Paul learns that one of his short stories will be published. On his way to tell Holly, he sees a newspaper headline saying that Trawler is married to someone else. Holly and Paul agree to spend the day together and take turns doing things each has never done before. At Tiffany's, Paul has the ring engraved from Doc Golightly's boxer Cracker Jack as a gift for Holly. After spending the night, he wakes up to find her away. When 2E arrives, Paul ends their relationship. She accepts it calmly, having earlier come to the conclusion that he and Holly are in love. Holly plans to marry José for his money, which makes Paul angry. After Holly receives a telegram informing her of Fred's death, she crushes her apartment. Months later, Paul moved. He is invited to dinner by Holly, who leaves for Brazil the next morning to continue her relationship with José. However, they are arrested in connection with Sally Tomato's drug ring, and Holly spends the night in jail. The next morning, Holly is released on bail and finds Paul waiting, and they take a taxi. He has her cat and a letter from José explaining that he has to end their relationship due to her arrest. Holly insists she will go to Brazil anyway, asks the taxi to pull over and leaves the",

From the cabin they send the driver generously and bribe him not to tell anyone about them. Alice and Judson look at the departure sign for The Silver Queen, on their way to Panama City, Panama, and look excited and anxious. Peggy Nolan is also waiting for the same flight for whom a delivery of expensive flowers is made with a ticket thanking her for the favor. Peggy contemptuously throws the card in the trash and gives the flowers to a woman who sells cheap gardeners. Shortly afterwards, the flight prepares to depart and we are introduced to Professor and Mrs Spengler, an elderly couple, and Joe, the flight's co-pilot, who is immediately attracted to Alice. Mrs. Spengler is a dominant woman, but her husband seems content to master like a child. While waiting on the tarmac near the plane, a car drives by and a well-dressed man appears with a young boy and another man. The boy is Tommy and he is sent away with 'uncle' Pete until his father - a master - can follow later. While the passengers are on board, Bill, the pilot, receives the message that they will return an anarchist to Panama, but he assures the group that there is nothing to worry about as the man will be in custody during the flight. be. The prisoner is Vasquez and is accompanied by a treasure hunter named Crimp. After Larry, the steward, helps settle everyone down, the flight departs with his twelve souls on board. Bill and Joe discuss plans for the postponement and Joe indicates that he has an interest in Alice. He goes back to the passenger compartment where beds have been made and people turn in for the night - except for Crimp who plans to stay up and make sure Vasquez does not 'go for a walk' - and cheats the hangman and himself out of $ 5,000. Peter catch up on his young costs for the night and help him say his prayers (something Pete does not know). Peggy comes to the cabin to visit Bill, whose rudeness finally makes it clear that he wants nothing to do with her. When Alice calls the steward, Joe takes the call and makes a play for her. The next morning the plane arrives for a gas stop in Mexico and the passengers have breakfast. Joe continues to chase Alice, assuming she's Judson's secretary. Peggy stabs once more to get Bill hot for her and is repulsed again. Then Pete tells her that her help is not needed if she tries to get Tommy to drink his milk. Peggy was \"marked\" as a loose woman by her fellow travelers who wanted nothing to do with her. Before boarding the plane, a reporter confronts Judson and Alice and Joe find out that she is engaged to her 'boss' and that they are evading. While the flight continues and is heading in stormy weather, the professor discusses the methods by which a South American tribe of hunters practice their craft. The conversation is interrupted by a news bulletin that tells how Tommy's father was killed. Peggy tries again to help Tommy and says \"he needs a wife.\" But Pete is still judicious and replies \"he needs a lady.\" Mrs. Spengler intervened and comforted Tommy. As the storm they are flying through gets worse, the passengers sit on their seats and Crimp insists that the pilots turn back. As the plane sways back and forth, some metal cylinders break loose and fall through the back door. Tommy comes dangerously close to going out the door when Llarry rescues him and hands him over to Pete. Just then the plane sinks sharply and Larry is thrown at the door after his death. While Joe and Bill try to steady the plane, Crimp tries to force them to turn back by waving his gun at them. In the fight, the gun goes off and is picked up by Vasquez. With a damaged engine, the Silver Queen crashes, and all eleven on board survive. The next morning Joe and Bill admit to the professor that they were blown away",

          "context": "The film depicts the construction and eventual demolition of a metaphorical wall. Although the symbolism of the film is open to interpretation, the wall itself reflects a sense of isolation and alienation. Pink (Bob Geldof), the protagonist (and unreliable narrator) of the film, is a rock star, one of several reasons behind his seemingly depressed and detached emotional state. He is first seen in a quiet hotel room, after bringing it into the trash. The opening music is not from Pink Floyd, but is the recording of Vera Lynn from 'The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot'. During the following scenes, it is revealed that Pink's father, a British soldier, was killed in action during Pink's infancy during World War II. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters' real father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who died during a battle in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in February 1944. English boy who grew up in the early fifties. During his childhood, Pink longed for a father figure after learning that his father had died in the war. At school he is humiliated by his mean and strict teacher for writing poems in class. The poems that the teacher grabs and reads to him are lyrics from 'Money' from the Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon. Pink is also influenced by his overprotective mother who spoils him by giving him what he wants. As an adult, Pink eventually marries as his fame grows like a rock star, but he and his wife grow apart and she has a relationship while Pink is on tour. When Pink finds out about the case, he compensates with expensive materialistic possessions and turns to a willing group (Jenny Wright), who he brings back to his hotel room, only to make it stand out in a wave of violence, terrified fleeing the room. . Pink is slowly starting to lose his head with metaphorical 'worms'. He shaves off all his body hair (an incident inspired by former bandmate Syd Barrett, who appeared during a recording session of Wish You Were Lord in 1975, after shaving his eyebrows and body hair) and while watching The Dam Busters on television watched, morph into his neo-Nazi alter-ego. Pink's manager (Bob Hoskins), along with the hotel manager (Michael Ensign) and some paramedics, break into the hotel room and discover Pink. They take him away to a guard limousine outside the hotel and inject him with drugs to enable him to act. The drugs make Pink hallucinate and he fantasizes that he is a neo-Nazi dictator, and his concert is a rally. His followers oppose ethnic minorities and rape the black girlfriend of a black man. Later, Pink holds a rally in suburban London and sings \"Waiting for the Worms\". The scene is mutilated by images of animated hammers walking across ruins. Pink screams \"Stop!\" and hides in a bathroom stall at the concert hall with poems that are later used as lyrics on Pink Floyd's \"Your Possible Pasts\" from The Final Cut album and \"5:11 AM (The Moment Of Clarity)\" by Roger Waters. 'The pros and cons of hiking. In a climate-animated series, Pink executes himself. He is depicted as a small, pink rag doll who rarely moves. The judge is a giant buttocks, with two legs to the back, an anus for a mouth and a scrotum for a chin. The lawyer is a tall, menacing, vulture-like man and the schoolmaster is an abusive, hateful puppet. After hearing the parties and witnesses (Pink's wife and mother), the judge ordered that the wall be demolished. The wall explodes and shows a montage of events from the entire film. The film concludes with three children clearing a heap of rubble after an earlier riot. It is unknown what happened to Pink that made the viewer decide. ",

          "context": "A lonely old woman longing for a child is given a seed by a good witch. When planted, the seed grows into a flower and inside the flower is a little girl as big as the old woman's thumb. The old woman calls the girl Thumbelina and raises her as her own. Although Thumbelina loves her mother, she longs for company of someone of her own size. One evening Cornelius, the fairytale prince, comes upon Thumbelina after hearing her beautiful song. The two ride on Cornelius' bumblebee and fall in love; During this ride, Mrs. Toad and her son Grundel are enchanted by the singing of Thumbelina. Cornelius promises to return the next day, but after he leaves, Mrs. Toumbelina kidnaps her from her bed and takes her away. Thumbelina wakes up on Mrs. Toad's display boat. Mrs Toad wants Thumbelina to join their group and marry Grundel, who is in love with her. They leave Thumbelina alone on a lily pad to fetch a priest, but a friendly swallow, Jacquimo (the narrator of the film), hears Thumbelina's cries for help and frees her. Jacquimo's friends, the jitterbugs, promise to help Thumbelina get home safely while Jacquimo leaves to track down Cornelius. Meanwhile, Cornelius learns of Thumbelina's abduction and dares to find her. While trying to get home, Thumbelina is led into a trap by Berkeley Beetle, who scares away the jitter bugs. He is delighted with her singing and promises to show her the way home once she sings on his Beetle Ball. Thumbelina agrees, but if she is badly received at the Beetle Ball, Beetle kicks her out without helping her. Winter is approaching. Jacquimo accidentally drops his wing on a thorn and is knocked out by the cold, while Cornelius falls into a lake and is frozen in ice. Grundel, who is looking for Thumbelina, finds Beetle and discovers that she is in love with Prince Cornelius and decides to find and kidnap Cornelius to lure Thumbelina to him. Grundel forces Beetle to help him because Grundel steals his wings and will not return them until Beetle has found and captured Cornelius. Thumbelina is picked up by Miss Fieldmouse, who tells her that Cornelius is deceased. The two visit Miss Fieldmouse's neighbor, Mr. Mole, which tells them about a dead bird he found in his tunnel earlier in the day. It turns out to be Jacquimo, who discovers Thumbelina that he is just unconscious. Mr. Mole wants to marry Thumbelina; sad about Cornelius' death, Thumbelina accepts. Jacquimo wakes up under Thumbelina's care and leaves to find Cornelius, refusing to believe he's dead. Meanwhile, Beetle brings Cornelius' frozen body to Grundel and informs him that Thumbelina is going to marry the Mole. After the two leave to stop the wedding, the young jitterbugs thaw Cornelius' body. At the wedding, Thumbelina realizes at the last minute that she cannot marry someone she does not love and refuses to take the vows. Grundel and Beetle crashed the wedding, but Thumbelina fled for them and Mr. Mole. Cornelius intercepts the crowd and confronts Grundel, the ensuing battle that leads to them both falling into an abyss. After being outside and free, Thumbelina is reunited with Jacquimo, who takes her to Cornelius' kingdom, the Vale of the Fairies. Cornelius appears, after surviving the fall, the couple is reunited, and Thumbelina accepts his proposal for marriage. The two kiss, and Thumbelina gets her own wings. With Thumbelina's mother and the fairytale court attended, Thumbelina and Cornelius are married and depart on their honeymoon on Cornelius' bumblebee. Images shown during the credits show that Beetle resumed his singing career and regained his wings, Mrs. Fieldmouse is with mr. Mole married, and Grundel also survived the fall with minor injuries and married a female path (implying that he lost interest in Thumbelina). ",

          "context": "New Orleans, Louisiana, 1927. A group of enraged men descend on the isolated Seven Doors Hotel deep in the swamps. They grab an artist named Schweik (Antoine Saint John), who is cloistered there. Accusing him of being a witch, Schweik is dragged into the basement where he is savagely beaten with heavy chains, tortured with quicklime acid, and crucified with his wrists nailed to the cellar wall, despite his dire warnings that he will be unleashed. evil. New Orleans, 1981. Liza Merril (Catriona MacColl) is a young woman who comes from New York City to claim the hotel as her inheritance. As soon as architect friend Marin Avery (Michele Mirabella) starts showing her around the property, strange incidents start to happen. A painter (Anthony Flees) falls off his platform and is horribly injured, coughing up blood and babbling about \"the eyes, the eyes.\" Dr. John McCabe (David Warbeck) arrives to take the injured man to the hospital and offers Liza some sympathy. Next, a plumber named Joe tries to repair a major leak in the flooded basement. However, he is killed by a presence that emerged from behind a thin-walled wall. The atmosphere in the hotel is further cooled by the creepy-looking servants, Arthur (Giampaolo Saccarola) and Martha (Veronica Lazar), who apparently come with the hotel. Martha discovers Joe's corpse in the basement and another much older corpse lying in a pool of dirty water nearby. Apparently it's that of Schweik, the artist. Driving down the 14-mile driveway toward New Orleans, Liza meets a strange blind woman, standing in the middle of the desolate highway. The blind woman introduces herself as Emily (Sarah Keller) and tells Liza that she has been waiting for her, even though her eyes are occluded by cataracts. Liza takes Emily to her luxuriously furnished home in New Orleans. Emily warns Liza to leave the hotel while she can. Meanwhile, at the hospital morgue, Dr. John McCabe performs an autopsy on Joe the plumber, while his assistant Harris (Al Cliver) wants to install an EMG machine on Schweik's corpse. John laughs and goes to lunch, while Harris stays to install the EMG machine. After Harris leaves for a call, the EMG machine begins to throb with activity. A little later, Joe's wife, Mary-Anne (Laura De Marchi), arrives with her daughter Jill (Maria Pia Marsale) to dress her husband's corpse for the funeral, when she is murdered in a horrific acid-scalded manner. . Jill is then threatened by Schweik's reanimated corpse. Liza meets with John McCabe in a downtown bar to discuss her misgivings and anxieties. He expresses perplexity when Lisa complains about the ineptitude of her strange servants. John claims that he had never heard of them before despite knowing everyone in the area. Then comes a phone call from Harris's bar informing John that Mary-Anne's body was found in the morgue, while Jill was found huddled in a corner scared and unable to speak. After Joe and Mary-Anne's funeral, Emily appears to Liza again that night at the hotel. Emily tells Liza about the witch Schweik, who stayed in room 36 of the hotel, and about the supernatural underworld that the hotel hides. The hotel was built on one of the Seven Gates of Hell and Schweik has been the Guardian. Emily is about to reveal more when her hands move closer to a canvas depicting a bleak vision of lost souls in a terrifying, barren landscape. Emily, suddenly frightened, says that the painting was painted by Schweik before he died, and runs out of the hotel lounge into the night. But Liza notices an unsettling fact about their sudden departure: Emily did not tread on the bare wooden planks as she ran, nor did her guide dog. The next day, Liza nervously ventures into Room 36, a gloomy ghost of sheet-covered furniture and rays of dusty light. She finds an ancient book, the strangely flesh-like cover of which bears the word",

          "context": "In ancient times, England was in crisis. With the death of the King, no one can decide who is the rightful heir to the throne. With war threatening to tear the country apart, a stone and anvil appear from the sky in the city of London, with a sword firmly embedded in the anvil. On the hilt of the sword, read the words: \"Whoever takes this sword from this stone and anvil, is king, born in England.\" Many try to draw the sword, but no one can move it. In time, the sword is forgotten and the Middle Ages plunged the countryside into a gloomy state. One day, in the woods, Sir Kaye goes hunting with his adopted brother Arthur, whom everyone calls 'Wart'. After making Kaye not shoot a deer, Arthur promises to get the arrow back. Arthur's journey leads him to a small cabin, in which a wizard named Merlin resides and his owl, Archimedes, who can speak. Merlin explains to Arthur that he expected him to show up. After having tea, Merlin decides to accompany Arthur back to his house, and after packing everything at the cabin in a small satchel, the two set out. Arthur and Merlin arrive at Sir Ector's castle, where Arthur immediately goes to work in the kitchen. Merlin introduces himself to Ector and shows his powers to the dubious Knight. After some persuasion, Ector allows Merlin to stay, placing him in the Northwest Tower, a ruined castle building. A few days later, Archimedes observes the arrival of Sir Pelinore, who has brought news from London about a jousting tournament to Ector and Kaye. According to the rules, the winner of the tournament will become the new King of England. Ector eagerly begins to get Kaye to train, and in his enthusiasm, he promises Arthur that if he keeps working hard at his duties, he can become Kaye's squire. Merlin learns of this news and decides to pressure Arthur to see his true potential (since Merlin can move into the past and the future, he knows who Arthur will become). As he walks through the castle moat, Merlin explains that he can turn into a fish. This idea excites Arthur, and Merline turns them both into fish to explore the moat. However, a much larger fish soon pursues young Arthur, until they both manage to escape. Arthur's delay in helping Kaye practice causes him to wash the dishes. Merlin finds him, and after haunting the dishes and washing the utensils, he leads Arthur into the forest, where they are both turned into squirrels by the sorcerer. When Arthur jumps through the trees, he meets a squirrel, who soon falls madly in love with him. Merlin finds the whole scene cute, until soon another squirrel finds it irresistible. Merlin then changes himself and Arthur to normal. The squirrel girl who was in love with Arthur, walks away, heartbroken. Arthur and Merlin return to the castle, where Ector lectures Merlin for making Arthur shirk his duties. Arthur tries to defend Merlin, but his 'charade' ends causing Ector to declare that Arthur will not become Kaye's squire, and that that honor will belong to someone else in the castle, who is named Hobbes. Arthur is heartbroken by what happened, but Merlin tries to get him to persevere and plans to educate Arthur. While trying to explain things, Archimedes intervenes in Merlin's teaching methods, as Merlin is educating Arthur about things that will not be proven for hundreds of years, and could very well lead people to think of Arthur as a delusional madman. in its current Middle Ages. . Exasperated by this lecture, Merlin hands over the teaching assignments to Archimedes, while he fiddles with a model airplane. Archimedes taunts the toy plane, while Merlin tries to prove that \"the man will fly.\" Their efforts cause the plane to plummet like a rock into the pit below. Despite the failure of the plane flight, Arthur recounts how he has often dreamed of flying like a bird. This is when Merlin uses his",

          "context": "Brink (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) has recently led Pud's (Bobs Watson) parents into a car accident. Brink then comes for Gramps (Lionel Barrymore). Believing Brink to be an ordinary stranger, the curmudgeonly old grandfather orders Mr. Brink to leave the property. Pud comes out of the house and asks who the stranger was. Grandpa is surprised and relieved that someone else could see the stranger; it was not simply a dream or an apparition. Pud tells Grandpa that when he does a good deed, he can make a wish. Because his apples are constantly being stolen, Grandpa wishes that anyone who climbs his apple tree has to stay there until he allows them to come down. Pud inadvertently tastes desire when he has trouble getting down from the tree, releasing himself only when Grandpa says he can. Pud's nosy Aunt Demetria (Eily Malyon) has plans for Pud and the money her parents left her. The grandmother spends a lot of time defending herself against her efforts to adopt the child. Brink leads Granny Nellie (Beulah Bondi) to a peaceful death right after she finishes a bit of knitting. When Mr. Brink returns again for Grandpa, the old man finally realizes who his visitor is. Determined not to leave Pud with Demetria, Grandpa tricks Mr. Brink into climbing the apple tree. While he is stuck in the tree, he cannot take Grandpa or anyone else. The only way someone or anything can die is if they touch Mr. Brink or the apple tree. Demetria plans for Gramps to be admitted to a mental hospital when she claims that Death is trapped in her apple tree. Gramps proves their story first by showing that their doctor, Dr. Evans (Henry Travers), can't even kill a fly they've caught. He offers further proof of his power by shooting Mr. Grimes (Nat Pendleton), the orderly who has come to take him to the asylum; Grimes lives when he should have died. Dr. Evans is now a believer, but tries to convince Grandpa to cheat Death so that suffering people can find deliverance. Grandpa refuses, so the doctor arranges for the local sheriff to turn over Grandpa while Pud is turned over to Demetria's custody. With the help of his housekeeper (Una Merkel), Grandpa tricks them both into believing that they are programmed to go with Mr. Brink when he comes down from the tree. They beg Grandpa to convince Brink otherwise, and Demetria vows never to bother Grandpa or Pud again. Grandpa realizes that sooner or later he will have to disappoint Brinks: death is an inevitable part of life. He tries to say goodbye to Pud, who reacts angrily and tries to flee. Mr. Brink sees Pud in the garden and challenges him to climb the tree. Pud passes the fence that Gramps had built around the tree, but falls and is crippled for life. Distraught, Grandpa lets Death climb down from the tree. He takes both Grandpa and Pud, who discover that they can walk again. In the final scene, they walk together down a beautiful country road and hear Grandma Nellie calling out to them from beyond a bright light. ",

          "context": "A Huey helicopter flies over the Alaskan wilderness, its pilots searching for someone below. That someone, Major Mitchell Gant USAF (Rtd) (Clint Eastwood), hears the helicopter approach and instantly runs into his cockpit, where he takes a shotgun from its mount and cocks it. When the helicopter lands, Gant falls into a post-traumatic memory of a nightmare he lived through in Vietnam: shot down over the north in his A-4, being taken to a prison camp when two Hueys machine-gunned his captors. . Gant suffered personal trauma when a flying A-4 dropped an incendiary bomb at the scene, killing a girl who stood too long watching the battle. Back in the present, Captain Arthur Buckholz (David Huffman) pulls Gant out of his episode and apologizes for the surprise. The following scenes are cuts back and forth between the conversation between Gant and Buckholz, and a briefing led by Kenneth Aubrey (Freddie Jones) of the British SIS on the Soviet Union's latest fighter / interceptor: the Mikoyan-Gurevich \"MiG\" Model 31, codenamed \"Firefox\" by NATO. Its capabilities seem out of another world: full stealth, twin engines delivering 50,000 pounds of thrust each, combat ceiling of 100,000 feet or more, speed exceeding Mach 5 or even Mach 6 (and capable of sustaining it, no small feat) and an armament. and defense system capable of reading the pilot's thoughts and allowing him to aim and fire his weapons without even having to press a button, giving him a 3-5 second reaction time advantage over any opponent. NATO's decision is to send Gant to steal a prototype Firefox right at the Soviet development base in Bilyarsk, near the Ural Mountains. Gant resents the operation because he is simply being blackmailed; He has been allowed to live on government land that will now be sold if he does not accept the mission. The NATO Air Force attaché (Thomas Hill) also resents it, because Gant has no experience as a spy and, worse still, is subject to post-traumatic stress disorder and can break down at any moment. They use Gant for only two reasons: He is fluent in Russian and it turns out to be a perfect fit for the pressure suit worn by the MiG-31's lead test pilot, Lt. Column. Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff) - Gant goes through several weeks of retraining, both in flight and air combat, and briefings on his first required impersonation, as a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague, known for smuggling heroin into the Soviet Union. After his training is over, he's sent to London, where Aubrey gives him his final report on his goals and he's disguised with a new haircut and a fake mustache. Gant is also familiar with the underground network group, who are mostly Russian Jews. Aubrey also hands him a one-way locating device disguised as a cheap transistor radio. However, what his handlers don't tell him is that if something compromises the mission, Gant will be left alone. Gant lands at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, makes his way through a customs registry without warning, and manages to get out of the airport on the \"radio.\" He takes a taxi to his rooms at the Hotel Moscow, puts the radio in his pocket, and waits. Outside he sees three Soviet soldiers taking goose steps in formation as they patrol. Meanwhile, at the KGB Moscow Center on Dzherzhinskiy Square, KGB Colonel Kontarsky (Kenneth Colley) finalizes his plans to safeguard the MiG-31 before his trials the next day to be held for the First Soviet secretary. He also orders his second-in-command, Dmitri Priabin (Oliver Cotton), to arrest some members of the underground at dawn, but not to move before then. Kontarsky, in fact, knows all about the spy ring that funnels information from Bilyarsk out of Russia, but even he does not know what the CIA and SIS have really planned. That night Gant walks to the Krasnokholmskiy Bridge, with instructions to be there at exactly 10:30 with the KGB following him; he is ordered",

          "context": "On a short trip back to London, the zealous and studious bacteriologist Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is dazzled by Kitty Garstin (Naomi Watts), a vivacious and vain London socialite. He Proposes; she agrees (\"just to get as far away from [her] mother as possible\"), and the couple are on their honeymoon in Venice. They then travel to Walter's medical post in Shanghai, where he is stationed in a government laboratory that studies infectious diseases. They find themselves ill-adjusted, with Kitty much more interested in parties and the social life of British expats. Kitty meets Charles Townsend (Liev Schreiber), a married British vice consul, and the two engage in an underground affair. When Walter discovers his wife's infidelity, he seeks to punish her by threatening to divorce her for adultery, if she does not accompany him to a small town in a remote area of China. He has volunteered to treat victims of an uncontrolled cholera epidemic sweeping the area. Kitty begs to be allowed to divorce him quietly, but he refuses, saying, \"Why should I get in the least bit of trouble for you?\" She hopes that Townsend will leave his wife Dorothy and marry her. When she proposes this possibility to Charles, he refuses to accept, despite having previously stated that he loves Kitty. She is forced to travel to the inland mountainous region with her husband. They embark on an arduous two-week overland journey that would be considerably faster and much easier if they traveled by river, but Walter is determined to make Kitty as unhappy and uncomfortable as possible. Upon his arrival in Mei-tan-fu, he is saddened to discover that they will live in near misery, far removed from everyone except his cheerful neighbor Waddington, a British deputy commissioner who lives with a young Chinese woman in relative affluence. Walter and Kitty hardly speak to each other and, except for a cook and a Chinese soldier assigned to watch over her, she is alone for many hours. After visiting an orphanage run by a group of French nuns, Kitty volunteers her services and is assigned to work in the music room. She is surprised to learn from the Mother Superior that her husband loves children, especially babies. In this setting, she begins to see him in a new light as she learns how selfless and caring he can be. When he sees her with the children, he in turn realizes that she is not the shallow, selfish person that he thought she was. As Walter's anger and Kitty's unhappiness subside, their marriage begins to flourish amid the epidemic crisis. She soon finds out that she is pregnant, but is not sure who the father is. Walter, in love again with Kitty, assures her that it doesn't matter. The cholera epidemic has many victims. As Walter and the locals are beginning to control it, entirely due to its importation of clean water through an aqueduct system (since local people did not understand water-borne infectious diseases [2] [better source needed] ) who carries cholera refugees from elsewhere arrive in the area, forcing Walter to set up a camp on the outskirts of the city. He contracts the disease and Kitty suckles him lovingly, but he dies and she is devastated. Stripped and pregnant, she leaves China. Five years later, Kitty appears well dressed and happy in London shopping with her young son Walter. They run into Townsend by chance on the street, and he suggests that Kitty meet him. Asking young Walter his age, he realizes the answer that the boy's father could have been. Kitty rejects his proposals and walks away. When her son asks who Townsend is, she replies, \"No one important, honey.\" ",

Proctor (Lance Kinsey) to the case, but while they are keeping watch, Wilson's gang manages to escape his fingers. The mayor wants Harris and Proctor to work with Major Lassard (George Gaynes), head of the Police Academy, to stop the gang. Lassard forms a seven-man team consisting of Hightower (Bubba Smith), Tackleberry (David Graf), Jones (Michael Winslow), Hooks (Marion Ramsey), Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), Fackler (Bruce Mahler) and Lassard's nephew, Nick. (Matt McCoy) who moves from Miami (in the previous movie Police Acdemy 5) to the city to stay close to his friends and silly uncle. After distributing flyers on Wilson's gang information and getting nowhere, Nick McCoy stumbles upon a paper header of an ancient diamond heading to a museum, and has an idea to use it as bait: however , the thieves catch the diamond anyway by cutting a hole in the truck and escaping through the sewer system. McCoy then decides to go undercover to get information on a possible hiding place, but Harris decides to go undercover to get a confession. It turns out that Harris infiltrates as a window cleaner into a tall building, making him afraid of heights, and gets a confession of himself on tape after his loyal but insensitive lackey, Proctor, accidentally knocks him down by him. balcony. . Here it is revealed that the robberies are committed by a group of three dumb criminals who do not seem to be able to do this on their own, and it is revealed that they are being led by a shadow figure literally known as \"Mastermind\", who speaks to them. the three behind a glass wall and uses a voice distortion device. He devises a plan to get the police out of the way. Commander Lassard and his men are later suspended after the jewels stolen from the latest robbery are placed in Lassard's locker, pending an investigation. The misfit cops decide to clear Lassard's name by capturing the gang and the ringleader. By accessing the data files from a computer, McCoy deduces that the thefts are taking place along a bus route, intentionally reducing property values in that part of town. They also learn that someone must be 'leaking' information to the bad guys, which is why they are always one step ahead of the Police Academy. The Police Academy force finds and fights with Wilson's gang, while Nick pursues the leader. A chase follows that leads to Commissioner Hurst's (George Robertson) office. It is revealed that the mayor is the \"brain\" and that Captain Harris has been unknowingly leaking information during his daily meetings with the mayor. Hurst apologizes and reinstates the force, and a plaque is presented the next day honoring the officers' bravery. When the movie ends, Harris is sitting in a chair when he cuts a rope that ties the balloon float, lifts his chair and floats it in the air while calling out Proctor's name. ",

      "paragraphs": [
        {
          "context": "The movie begins a few years in the future from this exact moment. We see advertisements everywhere (buildings, walls, bus stops, etc.) for the hit game Slayers, and how star character Kable (Gerard Butler) has four battles left before winning his freedom. Then we are shown an ongoing battle: a mass shooting inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players from elsewhere. Characters get points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to perform housework on the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. Simon (Logan Lerman), 17, plays / controls Kable and guides him around the factory. After killing most of those who cross his path, Kable is kicked out of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Subsequently, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, as he now only has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don't think that anyone will exit the game. Producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff Bob (John de Lancie) from the Gina Parker Smith Show talk about their next guest on the show: inmate genius Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the accomplishments of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game, but instead of controlling a fake character, players control a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can get paid to be controlled. The society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial game that is supported by the federal government. Castle defends the Slayers by stating that each character in the game, while real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game rather than serve their prison sentence. If a convict can survive thirty battles, he will be freed (although no one has survived that long). Some convicts are sent to the battlefields with pre-designed actions and will be freed if they survive a single battle, but are unable to defend themselves (making their death rate extremely high). In addition, the games are televised on pay-per-view. Everyone at Slayers and Society has had nano-cells implanted in their brains, making it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled at the perimeter of the game (meaning once the game is over, they regain control). After the program ends, Humanz, a resistance group, hacks the signal. Brother Humanz (Ludacris) condemns Castle and claims that eventually we will all be his slaves if we continue down this path. Castle is amused and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape, but ultimately fails. Kable sits alone and thinks of his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Kable. Talk about how Kable scares everyone else when he sits alone and is constantly thinking. He can't believe Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him why he is in prison. Kable has a quick flashback of a bleeding man in a room. Later, while sitting in his cell, someone opens the door slot and hands Kable a photo of his wife and son. The female voice on the other side knows that her family is the only thing she is fighting for. She has Kable sign an autograph for her son, David, and then takes a blood sample from his hand as proof of authenticity to increase the value of the autograph. Elsewhere, we see Kable's wife, Angie (Amber Valletta), working as a character on Society. Virtually every character in the game is dressed in ridiculous, skimpy costumes.",

          "context": "Early one morning, a taxi pulls up at Tiffany & amp; Co. on Fifth Avenue in New York City, from which the elegantly dressed Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) emerges. After looking through the store windows, he heads home. Outside his apartment, he fights back against Sid Arbuck (Claude Stroud), his date from the disastrous night before. Later, new neighbor Paul Varjak (George Peppard) wakes her up and rings the doorbell to enter the building. The couple chat as she dresses for her weekly visit with Sally Tomato (Alan Reed), a mobster incarcerated at Sing Sing Prison. Tomato's attorney, O'Shaughnessy, pays him $ 100 a week to deliver \"the weather report.\" Audrey Hepburn as Holly Golightly\nWhile going to Sing Sing, Holly is introduced to Paul's \"decorator\", wealthy older woman Emily Eustace Failenson (Patricia Neal), whom Paul nicknames \"2E\". That night, Holly goes out on the fire escape to avoid a very anxious date (Mel Blanc). He peeks into Paul's apartment and sees 2E leaving money and kissing Paul goodbye. After 2E leaves, Holly walks into Paul's apartment and learns that he is a writer who hasn't published anything since a cartoon book five years earlier. Holly, in turn, explains that she is trying to save money to support her brother Fred when he gets out of the army. The couple fall asleep, but wake up when Holly has a nightmare about Fred. Later he buys Paul a typewriter tape to apologize and invites him to a party at his apartment. There, Paul meets his Hollywood agent, O. J. Berman (Martin Balsam), who describes Holly's transformation from country girl to Manhattan socialite. They also introduce him to José Silva Pereira (José Luis de Vilallonga), a wealthy Brazilian politician, and Rusty Trawler (Stanley Adams), the \"ninth richest man in the United States under 50 years old.\" In the following days, Paul and Holly grow closer. One day, 2E walks into Paul's apartment, worried that she is being followed. Paul tells him that he will investigate and eventually confronts Doc Golightly (Buddy Ebsen), Holly's husband. Doc explains that Holly's real name is Lula Mae Barnes. They got married when she was 13 years old and he wants to take her back to Texas, since Fred will be back. After Paul reunites Holly and Doc, she tells Paul that the marriage was annulled. At the bus station, he tells Doc that he will not go with him. Doc leaves with a broken heart. After drinking at a club, Paul and Holly return to their apartment, where she, drunk, tells him that she plans to marry Trawler for his money. A few days later, Paul learns that one of his stories will be published. On the way to tell Holly, she sees a newspaper headline that says Trawler has married someone else. Holly and Paul agree to spend the day together, taking turns doing things they have never done before. At Tiffany's, Paul has Doc Golightly's Cracker Jack box ring engraved as a gift for Holly. After spending the night together, he wakes up to find that she is gone. When 2E arrives, Paul ends their relationship. She calmly accepts, having previously concluded that he and Holly are in love. Holly plans to marry José for his money, which infuriates Paul. After Holly receives a telegram notifying her of Fred's death, she trashes her apartment. Months later, Paul moved out. Holly invites him to dinner, which he leaves the next morning for Brazil to continue her relationship with José. However, they are arrested in connection with the Sally Tomato drug ring, and Holly spends the night in jail. The next morning, Holly is released on bail and finds Paul waiting, and they take a taxi. She has her cat and a letter from José explaining that she must end their relationship due to his arrest. Holly insists that she will go to Brazil anyway, asks the taxi to stop and drops the",

When they get out of the taxi they give the driver a generous tip, bribing him not to tell anyone about them. Alice and Judson check the exit sign for The Silver Queen, heading to Panama City, Panama, and they seem excited and anxious. Also waiting for the same flight is Peggy Nolan, who is delivered expensive flowers with a card thanking her for a favor. Peggy disdainfully tosses the card in the trash and hands the flowers to a woman who sells cheap gardenias. Soon after, the flight prepares to depart and we are introduced to the professor and Mrs. Spengler, an elderly couple, and Joe, the co-pilot of the flight, who is immediately attracted to Alice. Mrs. Spengler is a dominant woman, but her husband seems content to be commanded like a child. As they wait on the runway near the plane, a car arrives and a well-dressed man appears with a boy and another man. The boy is Tommy and he will be sent to \"Uncle\" Pete until his father, a mobster, can follow him later. As the passengers board, Bill, the pilot, receives word that an anarchist will be transported back to Panama, but assures the group that there is nothing to worry about as the man will be in custody during the flight. The prisoner is Vasquez, and he is accompanied by a bounty hunter named Crimp. After Larry, the butler, helps everyone get settled in, the flight leaves with his twelve souls on board. Bill and Joe discuss the plans for the stopover and Joe indicates that he has an interest in Alice. He returns to the passenger compartment where the beds have been made and people go to bed for the night, except for Crimp, who plans to stay awake and make sure that Vasquez does not \"go for a walk\", thus fooling the executioner. and himself for $ 5,000. Pete tucks in his young charge for the night and helps him say his prayers (something Pete is unfamiliar with). Peggy goes up to the booth to visit Bill, whose rudeness finally makes it clear that he wants nothing to do with her. When Alice calls the butler, Joe takes the call and makes a play for her. The next morning, the plane arrives for a refueling stop in Mexico and the passengers eat breakfast. Joe continues to chase Alice, under the assumption that she is Judson's secretary. Peggy tries to make Bill feel more affectionate with her and is rejected again. Later, Pete tells him that his help is not needed when he tries to get Tommy to drink his milk. Peggy has been \"branded\" as a laid-back woman by her fellow travelers who want nothing to do with her. Before boarding the plane, a journalist confronts Judson and Alice and Joe find out that she is engaged to her \"boss\" and they are on the run. As the flight continues and heads into stormy weather, the professor discusses the methods by which a South American tribe of headhunters practices their craft. The conversation is interrupted by a news bulletin recounting how Tommy's father has been killed. Peggy again tries to help Tommy, saying \"he needs a woman\". But Pete is still critical and responds \"he needs a lady\". Mrs. Spengler steps in and comforts Tommy. As the storm they go through gets rougher, passengers strap themselves to their seats and Crimp insists that the pilots turn around. As the plane rocks back and forth, a pair of metal cylinders break loose and smash through the rear door. Tommy is dangerously close to walking out the door when Llarry saves him and hands him over to Pete. At that moment, the plane tilts sharply and Larry is thrown out the door to his death. As Joe and Bill try to stabilize the plane, Crimp tries to force them back by waving his gun at them. In the fight, the gun goes off and is picked up by Vasquez. With a damaged engine, the Silver Queen crashes and all eleven on board survive. The next morning, Joe and Bill admit to the professor that their jaws dropped.",

          "context": "The film describes the final construction and demolition of a metaphorical wall. Although the symbolism of the film is open to interpretation, the wall itself clearly reflects a sense of isolation and alienation. Pink (Bob Geldof), the film's lead (and unreliable narrator), is a rock star, one of several reasons behind his seemingly depressed and distant emotional state. It is seen for the first time in a quiet hotel room, after having trashed it. The opening music is not from Pink Floyd, but from Vera Lynn's recording of \"The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot.\" During the following scenes, it is revealed that Pink's father, a British soldier, was killed in action during WWII during Pink's childhood. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters' real-life father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who was killed in combat in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in February 1944. English boy who grew up to early 1950s. Throughout her childhood, Pink yearns for a father figure after learning that her father died in the war. At school, his mean and severe teacher humiliates him for writing poems in class. The poems that the teacher snatches and reads aloud are lyrics from \"Money\" from the Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon. Pink is also affected by his overprotective mother who pampers him by giving him what he wants. As an adult, Pink eventually marries as his fame as a rock star grows, but he and his wife grow apart and she has an affair while Pink is on tour. When Pink learns of the affair, he makes up for it with expensive materialistic possessions and turns to a willing groupie (Jenny Wright), whom he brings back to his hotel room only to be thrown away in a fit of violence, which makes her flee the room in terror. . Pink slowly begins to lose her mind to the metaphorical \"worms\". He shaves off all his body hair (an incident inspired by former bandmate Syd Barrett, who appeared in a 1975 recording session for Wish You Were Here, after shaving his eyebrows and body hair) and, while watching The Dam Busters on television, it transforms. in his neo-Nazi alter ego. Pink's manager (Bob Hoskins), along with the hotel manager (Michael Ensign) and some paramedics, break into the hotel room and discover Pink. They take him to a limo waiting outside the hotel and inject him with drugs so he can function. The drugs make Pink hallucinate and fantasize that he is a neo-Nazi dictator, his concert is a rally. His followers proceed to attack ethnic minorities and rape the white girlfriend of a black man. Later, Pink holds a rally in the London suburbs, singing \"Waiting for the Worms.\" The scene is interspersed with images of animated marching hammers taking a goose-step through the ruins. Pink yells \"Stop!\" and takes refuge in a bathroom in the concert hall, reciting poems that would later be used as lyrics in Pink Floyd's \"Your Possible Pasts\" from The Final Cut album and \"5:11 AM (The Moment Of Clarity)\" by Roger Waters. . The pros and cons of hitchhiking. In a climactic animation sequence, Pink is put to the test. She is depicted as a small pink rag doll that rarely moves. The judge is a pair of giant buttocks, with two legs back, one anus for a mouth and a scrotum for a chin. The lawyer is a tall, menacing, vulture-like man and the schoolmaster is a hateful and abusive puppet. After hearing the parties and witnesses (Pink's wife and mother), the judge orders the wall to be torn down. The wall explodes and shows a montage of events from the entire movie. The film concludes with three children cleaning up a pile of rubble after a previous riot. It is unknown what happened to Pink, leaving the viewer to decide. ",

Gripped by grief over her husband's death, bound by nightmares, and emptied of all emotions beyond hatred and sadness, Stella (Kiele Sanchez) has spent the last few months traveling the world, trying to convince others that vampires exist in this world. Stella constantly feels like she is being hunted, and is acutely aware of the impending threat to her life, as the death of her husband Eben has robbed her of her ability to feel emotions, leaving her feeling cold and empty inside. Following the instructions of a mysterious man named Dane, he finally ends up in Los Angeles. One night, while lecturing an audience of people with whom she hopes to convince that vampires exist and aware that they attend when she speaks, she activates ultraviolet lamps on the ceiling that incinerate several of the vampires in the audience before they do. the humans.

After she is released from custody with a warning to keep quiet about the existence of vampires, she returns to her hotel room and finds three people waiting for her; Paul (Rhys Coiro), Amber (Diora Baird) and Todd (Harold Perrineau) who had been sent by Dane to collect her to hunt down the vampire queen Lilith, who they are convinced that once out of the way, the vampires will fall. in a more or less inactive way, as she is responsible for all his movements and keeping them hidden, when Stella asks if she is responsible for the incident at Barrow and is notified that it was. She is taken to meet Dane (Ben Cotton) and is shocked to find that he is also a vampire, though due to a superficially inflicted wound, he has maintained an understanding of humanity, only drinking blood from the packaged hospital existences he keeps.

At Dane's house, Stella and Paul get intimate and have sex. Meanwhile, Lilith (Mia Kirshner) decides that Agent Norris must prove his worth to become a vampire (to cure the throat or lung cancer he has been suffering from) and bites the neck of a captive girl, named Stacey (Katharine Isabelle). . , drinking his blood to death.

          "context": "A lonely old woman longing for a child receives a seed from a good witch. When planted, the seed becomes a flower, and inside the flower is a little girl the size of an old woman's thumb. The old woman names the girl Thumbelina and raises her as her own. Although Thumbelina loves her mother, she longs for the company of someone her size. One night, Cornelius, the prince of the fairies, bumps into Thumbelina after hearing her beautiful song. The two ride on Cornelius's bumblebee and fall in love; During this walk, Mrs. Toad and her son Grundel are delighted with Thumbelina singing. Cornelius promises to return the next day, but after he's gone, Mrs. Toad kidnaps Thumbelina from her bed and takes her away. Thumbelina wakes up on Ms. Toad's show boat. Ms. Toad wants Thumbelina to join her group and marry Grundel, who has a crush on her. Thumbelina is left alone on a lily pad to go find a priest, but a friendly swallow, Jacquimo (the film's narrator), hears Thumbelina's cries for help and frees her. Jacquimo's friends, the jitterbugs, promise to help Thumbelina get home safely while Jacquimo sets off to find Cornelius. Meanwhile, Cornelius finds out about Thumbelina's kidnapping and ventures out to find her. While trying to get home, Thumbelina is ambushed by the Berkeley Beetle, who scares the jitterbugs. He is in love with her singing and promises to show her the way home if she sings at her Beetle Ball first. Thumbelina agrees, but when she is badly received at the Beetle Ball, Beetle kicks her out without helping her. Winter is coming. Jacquimo accidentally impales his wing with a thorn and is struck by the cold, while Cornelius falls into a lake and freezes in ice. Grundel, who is looking for Thumbelina, finds Beetle and discovers that she is in love with Prince Cornelius and, after being convinced by Beetle, decides to find and kidnap Cornelius to lure Thumbelina to him. Grundel forces Beetle to help him while Grundel steals his wings and will not return them until Beetle has found and captured Cornelius. Thumbelina is taken in by Miss Fieldmouse, who tells her that Cornelius is dead. The two visit Miss Fieldmouse's neighbor, Mr. Mole, who tells them about a dead bird he found in his tunnel earlier that day. It turns out to be Jacquimo, whom Thumbelina discovers is just unconscious. Mr. Mole wishes to marry Thumbelina; Heartbroken by Cornelius's death, Thumbelina agrees. Jacquimo wakes up under Thumbelina's care and goes to find Cornelius, refusing to believe that he is dead. Meanwhile, Beetle brings Cornelius's frozen body to Grundel and informs him that Thumbelina will marry Mole. After the two leave to stop the wedding, the young jitterbugs unfreeze Cornelius's body. At the wedding, Thumbelina realizes at the last moment that she cannot marry someone she does not love and refuses to take vows. Grundel and Beetle break up the wedding, but Thumbelina runs away from them and Mr. Mole. Cornelius intercepts the crowd and confronts Grundel, the resulting fight causing both of them to fall into an abyss. Once out and free, Thumbelina reunites with Jacquimo, who takes her to Cornelius' kingdom, the Valley of the Fairies. Cornelius appears, having survived the fall, the couple is reunited and Thumbelina accepts their marriage proposal. The two kiss and Thumbelina gets her own wings. With Thumbelina's mother and the court of fairies present, Thumbelina and Cornelius marry and go on a honeymoon in Cornelius's bumblebee. Pictures shown during the credits reveal that Beetle resumed her singing career and regained her wings, Mrs. Fieldmouse married Mr. Mole and Grundel also survived the fall with minor injuries and married a female toad (which implies that he lost interest in Thumbelina).

          "context": "New Orleans, Louisiana, 1927. A group of enraged men descend on the isolated Seven Doors Hotel at the bottom of the swamp. They catch an artist called Schweik (Antoine Saint John), who is cloistered there. Accusing him of being a sorcerer, Schweik is dragged into the cellar where he is savagely beaten with heavy chains, tortured with quicklime acid and crucified with his wrists nailed to a cellar wall, despite his terrible warnings of unleashing evil. New Orleans, 1981. Liza Merril (Catriona MacColl) is a young woman who arrives from New York to claim the hotel as her heirloom. Barely the architect friend Marin Avery (Michele Mirabella) begins to show him around the property, strange incidents begin to occur. A painter (Anthony Flees) falls off his platform and is horribly injured, coughing up blood and babbling \"eyes, eyes\". Dr John McCabe (David Warbeck) arrives to take the injured man to the hospital and offers Liza his sympathy. Next, a plumber, named Joe, tries to fix a major leak in the flooded cellar. However, he is assassinated by a presence that has emerged from behind a thin wall. The hotel's atmosphere is further cooled by the creepy servants, Arthur (Giampaolo Saccarola) and Martha (Veronica Lazar), who apparently come with the hotel. Martha discovers Joe's corpse in the basement and another much older corpse lying in a nearby pool of dirty water. It is apparently that of Schweik, the artist. Walking down the 14 mile causeway to New Orleans, Liza meets a strange blind woman standing in the middle of the desolate road. The blind woman introduces herself as Emily (Sarah Keller) and tells Liza that she was waiting for her, although her eyes are blocked with cataracts. Liza drives Emily to her richly furnished house in New Orleans. Liza is warned by Emily to leave the hotel while she can. Meanwhile in the hospital morgue, Dr. John McCabe performs the autopsy of Joe the Plumber while his assistant Harris (Al Cliver) wants to install an EMG machine on Schweik's corpse. John laughs and leaves for lunch, while Harris stays behind to set up the EMG machine. After Harris leaves on a call, the EMG machine begins to vibrate with activity. A little later, Joe's wife, Mary-Anne (Laura De Marchi), arrives with her daughter Jill (Maria Pia Marsale) to dress her husband's corpse for the funeral, when she is killed in a way horrible by scalding with acid. Jill is then threatened by the reanimated corpse of Schweik. Liza meets John McCabe at a downtown bar to discuss her apprehensions and anxieties. He expresses bewilderment when Lisa complains about the ineptitude of her strange servants. John claims to have never heard of it before even though he knew everyone in the area. Then a phone call from the bar arrives from Harris who informs John that Mary-Anne's body has been found in the morgue, while Jill is found huddled in a corner frightened and unable to speak. After Joe and Mary-Anne's funeral, Emily appears to Liza again that evening at the hotel. Emily tells Liza about the warlock Schweik, who stayed in room 36 of the hotel, and the supernatural underworld the hotel hides. The hotel was built over one of the Seven Gates of Hell, and Schweik was the keeper. Emily is about to reveal more when her hands wander over a canvas depicting a desolate vision of souls lost in a terrible, barren landscape. Suddenly frightened, Emily says the picture was painted by Schweik before her death and that she is running out of the hotel lounge at night. But Liza notices a disturbing fact about her sudden departure: Emily didn't step on the bare wooden planks while she ran, nor did her guide dog. The next day, Liza nervously ventures into Room 36, a dull fantasy of furniture covered in sheets and dusty skylights. She finds an old book, the oddly fleshy cover of which bears the only word",

          "context": "In ancient times, England was in turmoil. With the death of the king, no one can decide who is the rightful heir to the throne. As war threatens to tear the country apart, a stone and an anvil appear from the sky over the city of London, with a sword firmly planted in the anvil. On the hilt of the sword read the words: \"Whoever draws this sword from this stone and from this anvil is a sane king, born of England.\" Many try to draw the sword, but none can move it. In time, the sword is forgotten, and the Dark Ages plunge the countryside into dire straits. One day, in the woods, Sir Kaye goes hunting with his adopted brother Arthur, whom everyone calls \"wart\". After preventing Kaye from shooting a deer, Arthur promises to get the arrow back. Arthur's journey leads him to a small hut, where a wizard named Merlin resides and his pet owl, Archimedes, who can talk. Merlin explains to Arthur that he expected him to appear. After having tea, Merlin decides to accompany Arthur home, and after packing everything in the hut in a small satchel, the two leave. Arthur and Merlin arrive at Sir Ector's castle, where Arthur is immediately put to work in the kitchen. Merlin introduces himself to Ector and shows his powers to the doubting knight. After some persuasion, Ector allows Merlin to stay, placing him in the Northwest Tower, a ruined building in the castle. A few days later, Archimedes observes the arrival of Sir Pelinore, who has brought news from London of a jousting tournament to Ector and Kaye. According to the rules, the winner of the tournament will become the new King of England. Ector eagerly begins to train Kaye, and in his excitement, promises Arthur that if he continues to work hard at his homework, he can become Kaye's squire. Merlin hears about this news and decides to push Arthur to see his true potential (as Merlin can move into the past and the future, he knows who Arthur will become). While walking outside along the castle moat, Merlin explains that he can turn into a fish. This idea turns Arthur on, and Merline turns them both into fish, to explore the moat. However, a much larger fish soon gives chase to young Arthur, until they both manage to escape. Arthur's delay in helping Kaye train causes him to wash the dishes. Merlin finds him, and after bewitching the dishes and utensils, leads Arthur into the forest, where they are both turned into squirrels by the wizard. As Arthur jumps among the trees, he stumbles upon a squirrel girl, who is soon madly in love with him. Merlin finds the whole scenario cute, until it is soon found irresistible by another squirrel. Merlin and Arthur then return to normal. The squirrel girl who was in love with Arthur walked away, heartbroken. Arthur and Merlin return to the castle, where Ector lectures Merlin for forcing Arthur to evade his duties. Arthur tries to defend Merlin, but his \"word of mouth\" ending leads Ector to declare that Arthur will not become Kaye's squire, and that this honor will belong to another person in the castle, named Hobbes. Arthur is devastated by what happened, but Merlin tries to make him persevere and considers educating Arthur. As he tries to explain things, Archimedes intervenes on Merlin's teaching methods, as Merlin educates Arthur on things that will not be proven for hundreds of years, and could very well lead people to think of Arthur as a berserk in their current dark age. . Exasperated by this conference, Merlin entrusts the teaching duties to Archimedes, while he fiddles with a model airplane. Archimedes mocks the toy plane, while Merlin tries to prove that \"man will fly\". His efforts resulted in the plane collapsing like a boulder in the moat below. Even though the plane's flight was unsuccessful, Arthur recounts how he often dreamed of flying like a bird. It is then that Merlin uses his",

          "context": "Brink (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) recently took Pud's (Bobs Watson) parents in a car wreck. Brink later comes for Gramps (Lionel Barrymore). Believing Brink to be an ordinary stranger, the grumpy old man orders Mr. Brink to leave the property. Pud comes out of the house and asks who the stranger was. Gramps is surprised and relieved that someone else can see the stranger; it was not just a dream or an apparition. Pud tells Gramps that when he does a good deed, he can make a wish. Because his apples are constantly being stolen, Gramps wants anyone who climbs his apple tree to have to stay there until he allows them to descend. Pud inadvertently tests the wish when he struggles to descend the tree himself, only becoming free when Gramps says he can. Pud's Aunt Demetria (Eily Malyon) has pictures about Pud and the money her parents left her. Gramps spends a lot of time putting off efforts to adopt the boy. Brink takes Granny Nellie (Beulah Bondi) to a peaceful death right after finishing some knitting. When Mr. Brink returns for Gramps again, the old man finally realizes who his visitor is. Determined not to leave Pud to Demetria, Gramps prompts Mr. Brink to climb the apple tree. While he is stuck in the tree, he cannot take Gramps or anyone else. The only way for anyone or anything to die is to touch Mr. Brink or the apple tree. Demetria plots to have Gramps interned in a mental hospital when he claims death is trapped in his apple tree. Gramps first proves his story by proving that his doctor, Dr Evans (Henry Travers), can't even kill a fly they've caught. He offers further proof of his power by shooting Mr. Grimes (Nat Pendleton), the ordinance that came to lead him to the asylum; Grimes saw then that he should have died. Dr Evans is now a believer, but he tries to convince Gramps to let go of death so that people who are suffering can find release. Gramps refuses, so the doctor arranges for the local sheriff to commit Gramps while Pud is handed over to Demetria's care. With the help of his housekeeper (Una Merkel), Gramps tricks them both into believing that they have to accompany Mr. Brink when he comes down from the tree. They beg Gramps to convince Brink otherwise, and Demetria swears never to bother Gramps or Pud again. Gramps realizes that sooner or later he will have to let Brinks down - death is an inevitable part of life. He tries to say goodbye to Pud, who reacts with anger and tries to run away. Mr. Brink sees Pud in the yard and challenges him to climb the tree. Pud crosses the fence Gramps built around the tree, but falls and is crippled for life. Distraught, Gramps lets death descend from the tree. He takes on both Gramps and Pud, who find they can walk again. In the final scene, they walk down a beautiful country road together and hear Granny Nellie calling them from beyond in a shining light. ",

      "paragraphs": [
        {
          "context": "A Huey helicopter flies over the Alaskan wilderness, its pilots looking for someone below. That someone, Major Mitchell Gant USAF (Rtd) (Clint Eastwood), hears the helicopter approaching and instantly sets off towards his cabin, where he takes a shotgun from its holder and arms it. As the helicopter lands, Gant falls into post-tramautic memory of a nightmare he experienced in Vietnam: shot down over the North in his A-4, he was taken to a prison camp when two Huey strafed his captors. . Gant suffered personal trauma when a flying A-4 dropped an arsonist at the site, killing a little girl who stayed too long watching the battle. Back in the present, Captain Arthur Buckholz (David Huffman) pulls Gant out of his episode and apologizes for the surprise. The following scenes are back and forth between the conversation between Gant and Buckholz and a briefing hosted by Kenneth Aubrey (Freddie Jones) of the British SIS regarding the last fighter / interceptor of the Soviet Union: the Mikoyan-Gurevich \"MiG\" Model 31 , codenamed \"Firefox\" by NATO. Its capabilities seem from another world: total stealth, two engines each delivering 50,000 pounds of thrust, combat ceiling of over 100,000 feet, speed above Mach 5 or even Mach 6 (and able to maintain it, no small feat. ), and a weapon and defense system capable of reading the pilot's mind and allowing him to aim and fire his weapons without even having to press a button, giving him a reaction time advantage of 3 to 5 seconds on any opponent. NATO's decision is to send Gant to fly a Firefox prototype right next to the Soviet development base in Bilyarsk, near the Ural Mountains. Gant resents the operation because he is quite simply blackmailed; he was allowed to live on state land which will henceforth be sold under his orders if he does not accept the mission. NATO Air Force Attaché (Thomas Hill) blames him too, as Gant has no experience as a spy and, even worse, is prone to post-stress. traumatic and can crack at any time. They use Gant for only two reasons: it speaks fluent Russian and happens to be a perfect fit for the pressure suit worn by the MiG-31's main test pilot, Lt. Collar. Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff) .Gant undergoes several weeks of retraining, both in flight and in aerial combat, and briefings on his first impersonation - as a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague, known to smuggle heroin into the Soviet Union. Once his training is complete, he is sent to London where Aubrey gives him his final briefing on his goals and he is disguised with a new haircut and fake mustache. Gant is also familiar with the underground network group, which is mostly made up of Russian Jews. Aubrey also hands him a one-way return device disguised as a cheap transistor radio. What his managers don't tell him, however, is that if anything compromises the mission, Gant will be left to fend for himself. Gant lands at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, pushes his way through an unannounced customs search and manages to leave the airport - with the \"radio\". He takes a taxi to his rooms at the Moscow hotel, puts the radio in his pocket and waits. Outside, he sees three Soviet soldiers marching in formation as they patrol. Meanwhile, at the Moscow KGB Center in Dzherzhinskiy Square, KGB Colonel Kontarsky (Kenneth Colley) is finalizing his plans to save the MiG-31 before his trials the next day which will be conducted for the Soviet First Secretary. He also orders his second-in-command, Dmitri Priabin (Oliver Cotton), to arrest some members of the underground at dawn, but not to move until. Kontarsky actually knows all about the spy ring that routes Bilyarsk's information out of Russia - but even he doesn't know what the CIA and SIS really have planned. That night, Gant heads for the Krasnokholmskiy Bridge, under instructions to be there precisely at 10:30 a.m. with the KGB observing him - he is ordered",

          "context": "On a brief trip back to London, serious bacteriologist and book Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is dazzled by Kitty Garstin (Naomi Watts), a perennial and conceited socialite from London. He proposes; she accepts (\"only to get as far away from [her] mother as possible\"), and the couple's honeymoon in Venice. They go to Walter's medical post in Shanghai, where he is stationed in a government laboratory studying infectious diseases. They find themselves ill-suited, with Kitty much more interested in parties and the social life of British expats. Kitty meets Charles Townsend (Liev Schreiber), a married British Vice Consul, and the two engage in an underground affair. When Walter discovers his wife's infidelity, he seeks to punish her by threatening to divorce her for adultery, if she does not accompany him to a small village in a remote region of China. He volunteered to treat victims of an uncontrolled cholera epidemic raging in the region. Kitty asks for a quiet divorce, but he refuses, stating \"Why should I get into any trouble for you?\" She hopes Townsend will leave his wife Dorothy and marry her. When she offers Charles this possibility, he refuses to accept, although he earlier claimed to love Kitty. She is forced to travel to the interior mountainous region with her husband. They embark on a grueling two-week overland journey, which would be considerably faster and much easier if they traveled by river, but Walter is determined to make Kitty as miserable and uncomfortable as possible. Upon their arrival in Mei-tan-fu, she is saddened to discover that they will live in near poverty, far from everyone except their jolly neighbor Waddington, a British deputy commissioner living with a young Chinese girl in relative opulence. . Walter and Kitty barely speak to each other, and with the exception of a cook and a Chinese soldier assigned to guard her, she is alone for long hours. After visiting an orphanage run by a group of French nuns, Kitty offers her services and she is assigned to work in the music room. She is surprised to learn from the Mother Superior that her husband loves children, especially babies. In this setting, she begins to see him in a new light by learning how selfless and caring he can be. When he sees her with the children, he realizes in turn that she is not the superficial and selfish person he thought she was. As Walter's anger and Kitty's unhappiness subside, their marriage begins to blossom amid the epidemic crisis. She soon learns that she is pregnant, but does not know who the father is. Walter - again in love with Kitty - assures her that it doesn't matter. The cholera epidemic claims many victims. As Walter and the locals begin to bring it under control, entirely because of its import of potable water through a waterworks system (because the local population did not understand water-borne infectious diseases [2] [best source needed ]) Cholera carrying refugees from elsewhere flocked to the area, forcing Walter to set up a camp outside the city. He contracts the disease and Kitty lovingly cares for him, but he dies and she is devastated. Deprived and pregnant, she leaves China. Five years later, Kitty appears well dressed and happy while shopping in London with her young son Walter. They run into Townsend on the street and he suggests that Kitty meet him. Asking young Walter his age, he realizes the answer that he could have been the boy's father. Kitty rejects her openings and walks away. When her son asks who Townsend is, she replies \"No one important, honey.\" ",

It is revealed here that the thefts are committed by a group of three dark criminals who don't seem to be able to do it on their own, and it is revealed that they are being guided by a literally shadow figure known as \" Mastermind, \"who speaks to the three behind a glass wall and uses a voice distortion device. He hatches a plan to ward off the cops. Commander Lassard and his men were subsequently suspended after jewelry stolen from the last theft was planted in Lassard's locker, pending an investigation. The misfit cops decide to erase Lassard's name by catching the gang and the ringleader. By accessing the data files from a computer, McCoy deduces that thefts occur along a bus route, intentionally lowering property values in this part of town. They also learn that someone needs to \"leak\" information to the bad guys, which is why they're always one step ahead of the Police Academy. The Police Academy force finds and fights the Wilson gang, while Nick pursues the leader. A chase ensues, which leads to the office of Commissioner Hurst (George Robertson). It is revealed that the mayor is the \"mastermind\" and that Captain Harris unwittingly leaked information during his daily meetings with the mayor. Hurst apologizes and restores strength, and a plaque is presented to honor the bravery of the officers the next day. At the end of the movie, Harris is sitting in a chair when a string attaching the balloon's float is cut, lifting his chair up and making him float in the air as he calls out Proctor's name. ",

          "context": "The film begins a few years in the future from this exact moment. We see ads everywhere (buildings, walls, bus stops, etc.) for the hit game Slayers, and how star character Kable (Gerard Butler) has four more battles before he gains his freedom. We are then shown an ongoing battle: a massive shootout inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters earn points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters perform menial tasks on the battlefield, seemingly oblivious to all the violence that surrounds them. 17-year-old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays / controls Kable and drives him around the factory. After slaughtering almost everyone in his own way, Kable blows himself up outside the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Then, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on his victory, as he only has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don't believe that anyone will be released from the game. Producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next guest for the show - recluse genius Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the accomplishments of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game, but instead of controlling a fake character, players control a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can get paid to be controlled. The Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago, Castle created Slayers, a controversial game backed by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that every character in the game, despite being real people, are all death row inmates who have chosen to enroll in the game instead of serving their prison time. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, he will be freed (although no one has survived that long). Some convicts are sent to battlefields with preconceived actions to take, and will be freed if they survive a single battle, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high). In addition, the games are all TV pay-per-view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nanocells implanted in their brains, which allows them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled within the perimeter of the game (meaning that after the game ends, they regain control). Once the show is over, the signal is hacked by Humanz, a resistance group. Brother Humanz (Ludacris) condemns Castle and declares that ultimately we will all be his slaves if we continue on this path. Castle gets kicked and asks his men to try to locate where the signal is coming from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape but in the end he fails. Kable sits alone and thinks about his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Kable. He tells of how Kable scares everyone when he sits alone and constantly thinks. He can't believe Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him why he is in jail. Kable has a quick flashback of a bleeding man in a room. Later, while sitting in his cell, someone opens the slit in the door and hands Kable a picture of his wife and child. The female voice on the other side knows that his family is the only thing he's fighting for. She has Kable sign an autograph for her son, David, then takes a blood sample from his hand as proof of authenticity to increase the value of the autograph. Elsewhere, we see Kable's wife Angie (Amber Valletta) going to work as a character in the company. Virtually all of the characters in the game are dressed in silly, skimpy costumes",

After looking in the shop windows, she returns home. Outside her apartment, she pushes Sid Arbuck (Claude Stroud) away, her date the disastrous night before. Later, she is awakened by new neighbor Paul Varjak (George Peppard), ringing her doorbell to enter the building. The couple chat as she gets dressed to leave for her weekly visit to Sally Tomato (Alan Reed), a gangster incarcerated at Sing Sing Prison. Tomato's attorney, O'Shaughnessy, pays him $ 100 a week to deliver \"the weather report.\" Audrey Hepburn as Holly Golightly\nAs she leaves for Sing Sing, Holly is introduced to Paul's \"decorator\", the wealthy elderly woman Emily Eustace Failenson (Patricia Neal), whom Paul nicknames \"2E\". That night, Holly comes out on the fire escape to escape an over-impatient date (Mel Blanc). She peeks into Paul's apartment and sees 2E leaving some money and kissing Paul goodbye. After 2E leaves, Holly walks into Paul's apartment and learns that he's a writer who hasn't published anything since a book of vignettes five years ago. Holly, in turn, explains that she is trying to save money to support her brother Fred when he comes out of the military. The couple fall asleep, but wake up when Holly has a nightmare about Fred. She later buys Paul a typewriter ribbon to apologize and invites him to a party in his apartment. There, Paul meets his Hollywood agent, O. J. Berman (Martin Balsam), who describes Holly's transformation from country girl to Manhattan socialite. He is also introduced to Joséda Silva Pereira (José Luis de Vilallonga), a wealthy Brazilian politician, and Rusty Trawler (Stanley Adams), the \"ninth richest man in America under 50\". In the days that follow, Paul and Holly get closer. One day, 2E walks into Paul's apartment, worried about being followed. Paul tells her that he will investigate and eventually confront Doc Golightly (Buddy Ebsen), Holly's estranged husband. Doc explains that Holly's real name is Lula Mae Barnes. They got married when she was 13 and he wants to take her back to Texas because Fred will be back. After Paul reunites Holly and Doc, she tells Paul that the wedding has been called off. At the bus station, she tells Doc that she is not going with him. Doc leaves heartbroken. After drinking at a club, Paul and Holly return to her apartment, where she tells him drunk that she is considering marrying Trawler for her money. A few days later, Paul learns that one of his short stories will be published. On his way to tell Holly, he sees a newspaper headline indicating that Trawler married someone else. Holly and Paul agree to take turns spending the day together doing things each other has never done before. At Tiffany's, Paul has the ring from Doc Golightly's Cracker Jack box engraved as a gift for Holly. After spending the night together, he wakes up to find her gone. When 2E arrives, Paul ends their relationship. She calmly agrees, having earlier concluded that he and Holly were in love. Holly plans to marry José for her money, which angers Paul. After Holly receives a telegram informing her of Fred's death, she trashes her apartment. Months later, Paul moved. He is invited to dinner by Holly, who leaves the next morning for Brazil to continue her relationship with José. However, they are arrested in connection with Sally Tomato's drug ring and Holly spends the night in jail. The next morning, Holly is released on bail and finds Paul waiting, and they take a cab. He has his cat and a letter from José explaining that he must end their relationship due to his arrest. Holly insists she will go to Brazil anyway, asks the cab to stop and releases the",

As they get out of the taxi, they tip the driver generously, bribing him so he doesn't tell anyone about them. Alice and Judson check the departure sign for The Silver Queen, heading for Panama City, Panama, and appear excited and anxious. Peggy Nolan is also waiting for the same flight, to whom an expensive flower delivery is made with a card thanking her for a favor. Peggy disdainfully throws the card in the trash and gives the flowers to a woman selling inexpensive gardenias. Soon after, the flight is about to leave and we are introduced to the teacher and Mrs. Spengler, an elderly couple, and Joe, the flight's co-pilot, who is immediately drawn to Alice. Ms Spengler is a domineering woman, but her husband seems content to be led like a child. As they wait on the tarmac near the plane, a car arrives and a well-dressed man emerges with a young boy and another man. The boy's name is Tommy and he is fired with “Uncle” Pete until his father - a gangster - can follow him later. As the passengers board, Bill, the pilot, learns that they are going to bring an anarchist back to Panama, but assures the group that there is nothing to fear since the man will be in custody during the flight. The prisoner is Vasquez and is accompanied by a bounty hunter named Crimp. After the Steward's Larry helps everyone get settled, the flight departs with his twelve souls on board. Bill and Joe discuss plans for the stopover and Joe indicates that he has an interest in Alice. He returns to the cockpit where the beds were made and people come in for the night - except for Crimp who plans to stay awake and make sure Vasquez doesn't \"go for a walk\" - thus deceiving the hangman. and himself on $ 5,000. Pete takes in his young load for the night and helps him say his prayers (which Pete doesn't know). Peggy goes up to the cockpit to visit Bill, whose rudeness finally shows that he doesn't want anything to do with her. When Alice rings for the steward, Joe takes the call and does a play for her. The next morning, the plane arrives for a refueling stopover in Mexico and the passengers have breakfast. Joe continues to pursue Alice, assuming she is Judson's secretary. Peggy again tries to get Bill to warm up with her and is pushed back again. Then Pete tells her that her help isn't needed when she tries to get Tommy to drink her milk. Peggy has been \"marked\" as a cowardly woman by her fellow travelers who want nothing to do with her. Before getting on the plane, a reporter confronts Judson and Alice and Joe learns that she is engaged to his \"boss\" and they run away. As the flight continues and heads into stormy weather, the professor discusses the methods by which a South American tribe of headhunters practice their craft. The conversation is interrupted by a newsletter that tells how Tommy's father was killed. Peggy tries to help Tommy again by saying \"he needs a wife\". But Pete is still judgmental and replies \"he needs a lady\". Mrs. Spengler steps in and comforts Tommy. As the storm they are passing through grows harsher, the passengers buckle down to their seats and Crimp insists the pilots return. As the plane rocks back and forth, two metal cylinders break loose and crash through the rear door. Tommy walks dangerously close to leaving when Llarry saves him and hands him over to Pete. Just then, the plane dives sharply and Larry is thrown out the door to his death. As Joe and Bill try to stabilize the plane, Crimp tries to force them to turn around by waving his gun at them. In the fight, the weapon leaves and is picked up by Vasquez. With a damaged engine, the Silver Queen crashes and the eleven on board survive. The next morning Joe and Bill admit to the professor that they were blown away",

While the symbolism of the film is open to interpretation, the wall itself clearly reflects a sense of isolation and alienation. Pink (Bob Geldof), the film's protagonist (and unreliable narrator), is a rock star, one of the many reasons behind his apparent depressed and detached emotional state. He is first seen in a quiet hotel room, after having ransacked it. The opening music is not by Pink Floyd, but from Vera Lynn's recording of \"The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot\". During the following scenes, it is revealed that Pink's father, a British soldier, was killed in action during World War II during Pink's childhood. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters' real father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who died in action in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in February 1944. English boy growing up in the early 1950s. Throughout her childhood, Pink yearns for a father figure after learning that her father died in war. At school, he is humiliated by his mean and stern teacher for writing poems in class. The poems the teacher grabs him and reads aloud are lyrics to \"Money\" from the Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon. Pink is also affected by his overprotective mother who spoils him by giving him what he wants. As an adult, Pink ends up getting married as his rock star fame grows, but he and his wife go their separate ways and she has an affair while Pink is on tour. When Pink learns of the affair, he compensates with expensive materialistic possessions and turns to a willing groupie (Jenny Wright), whom he brings back to her hotel room only to trash her in a fit of violence, causing her to flee the city. terrified room. . Pink slowly begins to lose her mind in the face of metaphorical “verses”. He shaves all of his hair (an incident inspired by former band member Syd Barrett, who appeared during a recording session for Wish You Were Here in 1975, after shaving his eyebrows and body hair. ) and, while watching The Dam Busters on TV, morphs into his neo-Nazi alter ego. Pink's manager (Bob Hoskins), along with the hotel manager (Michael Ensign) and paramedics, enter the hotel room and find Pink. They take her in a limo waiting outside the hotel and inject her with drugs to allow her to perform. The drugs hallucinate Pink and he fantasizes that he is a neo-Nazi dictator, his concert is a rally. His supporters attack ethnic minorities and rape a black man's white girlfriend. Later, Pink holds a rally on the outskirts of London, singing \"Waiting for the Worms\". The scene is interspersed with images of animated hammers marching through the ruins. Rose yells \"Stop!\" and take refuge in a bathroom cubicle in the concert hall, reciting poems that would later be used as Pink Floyd's lyrics \"Your Possible Pasts\" from the Final Cut album and \"5:11 AM (The Moment Of Clarity) \"by Roger Waters\" The pros and cons of hitch riding. In an animated climatic sequence, Pink puts herself to the test. He is depicted as a little pink rag doll that rarely moves. The judge is a pair of giant buttocks, with two legs turned backwards, an anus for a mouth and a scrotum for a chin. The lawyer is a tall, menacing and vultural man, and the schoolmaster is an abusive and hateful puppet. After hearing the parties and witnesses (Pink's wife and mother), the judge orders the wall to be demolished. The wall explodes and shows a montage of events from the entire movie. The film ends with three children cleaning up a pile of debris after an earlier riot. It's unclear what happened to Pink, leaving the viewer to decide. ",

          "context": "A lonely old woman who longs for a child receives a seed from a good witch. Once planted, the seed turns into a flower and inside the flower is a little girl the size of the old woman's thumb. The old woman names the daughter Thumbelina and brings her up as her own. Although Thumbelina loves her mother, she longs for the company of someone her size. One night, Cornelius, the prince of the fairies, stumbles upon Thumbelina after hearing her beautiful song. The two take a ride on Cornelius' drone and fall in love; during this walk, Mrs. Toad and her son Grundel are enchanted by the song of Thumbelina. Cornelius promises to return the next day, but after he leaves, Mrs. Toad kidnaps Thumbelina from her bed and takes her away. Thumbelina wakes up on Ms. Toad's demonstration boat. Ms. Toad wants Thumbelina to join their troop and marry Grundel, who is in love with her. They leave Thumbelina alone on a water lily to fetch a priest, but a friendly swallow, Jacquimo (the film's narrator), overhears Thumbelina's calls for help and frees her. Jacquimo's friends, the jitterbugs, promise to help Thumbelina get home safely while Jacquimo goes in search of Cornelius. Meanwhile, Cornelius learns of Thumbelina's kidnapping and ventures to find her. While trying to get home, Thumbelina is ambushed by Berkeley Beetle, who scares off the jitterbugs. He is in love with her singing and promises to show her the way home if she sings to his Beetle Ball first. Thumbelina agrees, but when she is badly received at the Beetle Ball, Beetle kicks her out without helping her. Winter is coming. Jacquimo accidentally impales his wing on a thorn and is knocked out by the cold, while Cornelius falls into a lake and is frozen in ice. Grundel, who is looking for Thumbelina, finds Beetle and finds out that she is in love with Prince Cornelius and upon some convincing Beetle, decides to find and kidnap Cornelius to lure Thumbelina towards him. Grundel forces Beetle to help him as Grundel steals his wings and won't return them until Beetle finds and captures Cornelius. Thumbelina is taken in by Miss Fieldmouse, who tells her that Cornelius is deceased. The two visit Miss Fieldmouse's neighbor, Mr. Mole, who tells them about a dead bird he found in his tunnel earlier today. It turns out to be Jacquimo, whom Thumbelina discovers to be only unconscious. Mr. Mole wishes to marry Thumbelina; heartbroken by Cornelius' death, Thumbelina accepts. Jacquimo wakes up in Thumbelina's care and goes in search of Cornelius, refusing to believe he is dead. Meanwhile, Beetle brings Cornelius' frozen body to Grundel and informs him that Thumbelina is going to marry the mole. After the two leave to end the marriage, the young jitterbugs thaw Cornelius' body. At the wedding, Thumbelina realizes at the last moment that she cannot marry someone she does not like and refuses to take the vows. Grundel and Beetle crush the marriage, but Thumbelina runs away from them and Mr. Mole. Cornelius intercepts the crowd and confronts Grundel, the ensuing fight drops them both into an abyss. Once outside and free, Thumbelina finds Jacquimo, who takes him to the kingdom of Cornelius, the Vale of the Fairies. Cornelius appears, having survived the Fall, the couple are reunited and Thumbelina accepts his marriage proposal. The two kiss and Thumbelina gets her own wings. In the presence of Thumbelina's mother and the fairy court, Thumbelina and Cornelius are married and go on their honeymoon on Cornelius' bumblebee. The images shown in the credits reveal that Beetle resumed her singing career and had regained her wings, Ms. Fieldmouse married Mr. Mole and Grundel also survived the fall with minor injuries and married a toad (implying that ' he lost all interest in Thumbelina).

          "context": "\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana, 1927. An enraged posse of men descend on the isolated Seven Doors Hotel deep in the swamps. They grab an artist called Schweik (Antoine Saint John), who is cloistered there. Accusing him of being a warlock, Schweik is dragged down to the cellar where he is savagely beaten with heavy chains, tortured with quicklime acid, and crucified with his wrists nailed to a cellar wall, despite his dire warnings of evil to be unleashed.New Orleans, 1981. Liza Merril (Catriona MacColl) is a young woman who arrives from New York City to claim the hotel as her inheritance. No sooner has architect friend Marin Avery (Michele Mirabella) begins to show her around the property, strange incidents begin to happen. A painter (Anthony Flees) falls off his rig and is horribly injured, coughing up blood and babbling about, \"the eyes, the eyes.\" Dr. John McCabe (David Warbeck) arrives to take the injured man to the hospital, and offers Liza some sympathy. Next, a plumber, named Joe, attempts to repair a major leak in the flooded cellar. However, he is murdered by a presence that emerged from behind a slim-caked wall. The atmosphere at the hotel is further chilled by the creepy-looking servants, Arthur (Giampaolo Saccarola) and Martha (Veronica Lazar), who apparently come with the hotel. Martha discovers Joe's dead body in the cellar, and another much older cadaver lying in a pool of dirty water nearby. It is apparently that of Schweik, the artist.Driving down the 14-mile causeway to New Orleans, Liza encounters a strange blind woman, standing in the middle of the desolate highway. The blind woman introduces herself as Emily (Sarah Keller), and tells Liza that she has been waiting for her, although her eyes are occluded with cataracts. Liza drives Emily over to her opulently furnished house in New Orleans. Liza is warned by Emily to leave the hotel while she still can. Meanwhile at the hospital morgue, Dr. John McCabe is performing the autopsy on Joe the plumber while his assistant Harris (Al Cliver) wants to install an EMG machine to the corpse of Schweik. John laughs it off and leaves for lunch, while Harris remains behind to install the EMG machine. After Harris leaves for a call, the EMG machine begins pulsing with activity. A little later, Joe's wife Mary-Anne (Laura De Marchi) arrives with her daughter Jill (Maria Pia Marsale) to dress up her husband's corpse for the funeral, when she is killed in a horrific way by scalded with acid. Jill is then menaced by the re-animated cadaver of Schweik.Liza meets with John McCabe in a downtown bar to discuss her misgivings and anxieties. He expresses puzzlement when Lisa complains about he ineptitude of her weird servants. John claims to have never heard of them before despite knowing everyone in the area. Then a phone call from the bar arrives from Harris who informs John that Mary-Anne's body was found in the morgue, while Jill was found huddled in a corner frightened and unable to speak. After Joe and Mary-Anne's funeral, Emily appears again to Liza that evening at the hotel. Emily tells Liza about the warlock Schweik, who stayed in Room 36 of the hotel and about the supernatural underworld that the hotel conceals. The hotel was built over one of the Seven Gates of Hell, and Schweik has been the Guardian. Emily is about to reveal more when her hands wander over to a canvas depicting a desolate vision of lost souls in a terrible and arid landscape. Suddenly afraid, Emily says that the painting was painted by Schweik before he died, and she runs out of the hotel parlor into the night. But Liza notices a disquieting fact about her sudden departure: Emily made no footfalls on the bare wooden boards as she ran, and neither did her seeing-eye dog.The next day, Liza ventures nervously into Room 36, a dingy phantasmal of sheet-covered furniture and shafts of dusty light. She finds an ancient book, whose weirdly flesh-like cover bears the single word",

          "context": "\n\nIn olden times, England is in turmoil. With the death of the King, noone can decide who is the rightful heir to the throne. With war threatening to tear the country asunder, a stone and anvil appear from the heavens in London town, with a sword planted firmly in the anvil. On the hilt of the sword, read the words, \"Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil is rightwise king, born of England.\" Many try to pull the sword, but none can budge it. In time, the sword is forgotten, and the Dark Ages plunge the countryside into a dismal state.Out in the woods one day, Sir Kaye is out hunting with his adopted brother Arthur, whom everyone names 'Wart.' After causing Kaye to miss shooting a deer, Arthur promises to retrieve the arrow. Arthur's journey leads him to a small hut, wherein resides a sorcerer named Merlin, and his pet owl, Archimedes, who can talk. Merlin explains to Arthur that he was expecting him to appear. After they have tea, Merlin decides to accompany Arthur back to his home, and after packing up everything in the hut into a small satchel, the two set off.Arthur and Merlin arrive at the castle of Sir Ector, where Arthur is immediately put to work in the kitchen. Merlin introduces himself to Ector, and displays his powers to the doubting Knight. After some persuasion, Ector allows Merlin to stay, putting him up in the Northwest Tower, a crumbling edifice of the castle.A few days later, Archimedes observes the arrival of Sir Pelinore, who has brought news from London of a jousting tournament to Ector and Kaye. According to the rules, the winner of the tournament will become the new King of England. Ector eagerly begins to have Kaye train, and in his excitement, promises Arthur that if he keeps working hard at his duties, he can become Kaye's squire.Merlin hears of this news, and decides to push Arthur to see his true potential (as Merlin can move into the past and the future, he knows who Arthur will become). While walking outside along the castle's moat, Merlin explains that he can turn into a fish. This idea excites Arthur, and Merline turns them both into fish, to explore the moat. However, a much larger fish soon gives chase to young Arthur, until they both manage to escape.Arthur's tardiness in helping Kaye practice results in him washing dishes. Merlin finds him, and after bewitching the dishes and washing utensils, leads Arthur into the forest, where they both are turned into squirrels by the sorcerer. As Arthur leaps among the trees, he comes across a girl squirrel, who is soon madly infatuated with him. Merlin finds the whole scenario cute, until he is soon found irresistible by another squirrel. Merlin then changes himself and Arthur back to normal. The girl squirrel who was infatuated with Arthur, skitters away, heartbroken.Arthur and Merlin return to the castle, where Ector lectures Merlin for making Arthur shirk his duties. Arthur tries to defend Merlin, but his 'mouthing off' ends causes Ector to declare that Arthur will not become Kaye's squire, and that that honor will belong to another person of the castle, who is named Hobbes.Arthur is dejected at what has happened, but Merlin tries to get him to persevere, and plans to educate Arthur. As he attempts to explain things, Archimedes interjects on Merlin's teaching methods, as Merlin is educating Arthur on things that will not be proven for hundreds of years, and could very well lead people to think of Arthur as a raving lunatic in their current Dark Ages.Exasperated at this lecturing, Merlin turns teaching duties over to Archimedes, while he fiddles with a model plane. Archimedes scoffs at the toy plane, while Merlin attempts to prove that 'man will fly.' His efforts lead to the plane plummeting like a rock to the moat below. Even though the plane's flight was a failure, Arthur tells of how he's often dreamed of soaring like a bird. It is then that Merlin uses his ",

Believing Brink to be an ordinary stranger, the crotchety old Gramps orders Mr. Brink off the property. Pud comes out of the house and asks who the stranger was. Gramps is surprised and relieved that someone else could see the stranger; he was not merely a dream or apparition.\nPud tells Gramps that when he does a good deed, he will be able to make a wish. Because his apples are constantly being stolen, Gramps wishes that anyone who climbs up his apple tree will have to stay there until he permits them to climb down. Pud inadvertently tests the wish when he has trouble coming down from the tree himself, becoming free only when Gramps says he can.\nPud's busybody Aunt Demetria (Eily Malyon) has designs on Pud and the money left him by his parents. Gramps spends much time fending off her efforts to adopt the boy.\nBrink takes Granny Nellie (Beulah Bondi) in a peaceful death just after she finishes a bit of knitting. When Mr. Brink returns again for Gramps, the old man finally realizes who his visitor is. Determined not to leave Pud to Demetria, Gramps tricks Mr. Brink into climbing the apple tree. While stuck in the tree, he cannot take Gramps or anyone else. The only way anyone or anything can die is if they touch Mr. Brink or the apple tree.\nDemetria plots to have Gramps committed to a psychiatric hospital when he claims that Death is trapped in his apple tree. Gramps proves his story first by proving that his doctor, Dr. Evans (Henry Travers), can not even kill a fly they have captured. He offers further proof of his power by shooting Mr. Grimes (Nat Pendleton), the orderly who has come to take him to the asylum; Grimes lives when he should have died.\nDr. Evans is now a believer, but he tries to convince Gramps to let Death down so people who are suffering can find release. Gramps refuses, so the doctor arranges for the local sheriff to commit Gramps while Pud is delivered to Demetria's custody. With the help of his housekeeper (Una Merkel), Gramps tricks both of them into believing they are scheduled to go with Mr. Brink when he comes down from the tree. They beg Gramps to convince Brink otherwise, and Demetria vows never to bother Gramps or Pud again.\nGramps realizes that sooner or later he will have to let Brinks downâDeath is an ultimately unavoidable part of life. He tries to say goodbye to Pud, who reacts angrily and tries to run away. Mr. Brink sees Pud in the yard and dares him to climb the tree. Pud gets over the fence Gramps has had built around the tree, but falls and is crippled for life. Distraught, Gramps lets Death down from the tree. He takes both Gramps and Pud, who find they can walk again. In the final scene, they walk together up a beautiful country lane and hear Granny Nellie calling to them from beyond a brilliant light.\n",

        {
          "context": "\n\nA Huey helicopter flies over the Alaskan wilderness, its pilots looking for someone below. That someone, Major Mitchell Gant USAF (Rtd) (Clint Eastwood), hears the helicopter approaching and instantly breaks into a dead run back toward his cabin, where he takes a shotgun off its rack and cocks it. As the helicopter lands, Gant lapses into a post-tramautic memory of a nightmare that he lived through in Vietnam: shot down over the North in his A-4, he was being taken to a prison camp when two Hueys machine-gunned his captors. Gant suffered personal trauma when an overflying A-4 dropped an incendiary on the site, killing a little girl who stood around too long, watching the battle. Back in the present, Captain Arthur Buckholz (David Huffman) pulls Gant out of his episode and apologizes for the surprise.The next several scenes are back-and-forth cuts between the conversation between Gant and Buckholz, and a briefing being run by Kenneth Aubrey (Freddie Jones) of the British SIS concerning the Soviet Union's latest fighter/interceptor: the Mikoyan-Gurevich \"MiG\" Model 31, given the codename \"Firefox\" by NATO. Its capabilities seem otherworldly: total stealth, twin engines each delivering 50,000 pounds of thrust, combat ceiling 100,000-feet-plus, speed in excess of Mach 5 or even Mach 6 (and able to maintain it, no small feat), and a weapons and defense system able to read the pilot's thoughts and allow him to aim and fire his weapons without even having to press a button, thus affording him a 3- to 5-second reaction-time advantage over any opponent. NATO's descision is to send Gant in to steal a Firefox prototype right off the Soviet development base at Bilyarsk near the Ural Mountains.Gant resents the operation because he is being quite simply blackmailed; he has been allowed to live on government land which now will be sold out from under him if he does not agree to the mission. The NATO Air Force attache (Thomas Hill) resents it, too, because Gant has no experience as a spy and, worse yet, is subject to post-traumatic stress disorder and may crack at any time. They use Gant for two reasons only: he speaks fluent Russian and happens to be a perfect fit for the pressure suit worn by the MiG-31's prime test pilot, Lt. Col. Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff).Gant goes through several weeks of retraining, both in flying and in aerial combat, and briefings on his first required impersonation--as a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague, known to be smuggling heroin into the Soviet Union. After his training is over he is sent to London where Aubrey gives him his final briefing on his objectives and he's disguised with a new haircut and a false mustache. Gant is also familiarized with the underground network group, who are mostly Russian Jews. Aubrey also hands him a one-way homing device disguised as a cheap transistor radio. What his handlers don't tell him, though, is that if anything compromises the mission, Gant will be left on his own.Gant lands at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow, blusters his way through an unannounced customs search, and manages to leave the airport--with the \"radio.\" He takes a taxi to his rooms at the Hotel Moscow, puts the radio into his pocket, and waits. Outside he sees three Soviet soldiers goose-stepping in formation while patrolling.In the meantime, at KGB Moscow Center on Dzherzhinskiy Square, Colonel Kontarsky (Kenneth Colley) of the KGB finalizes his plans to safeguard the MiG-31 prior to its trials the next day which will be conducted for the Soviet First Secretary. He also orders his second-in-command, Dmitri Priabin (Oliver Cotton), to arrest some underground members at dawn, but not to move before then. Kontarsky in fact knows all about the spy network funneling information from Bilyarsk out of Russia--but even he does not know what the CIA and the SIS really have planned.That night Gant walks out to the Krasnokholmskiy Bridge, under instructions to be there at precisely 10:30 with the KGB shadowing him -- he is ordered ",

          "context": "On a brief trip back to London, earnest, bookish bacteriologist Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is dazzled by Kitty Garstin (Naomi Watts), a vivacious and vain London socialite. He proposes; she accepts (\"only to get as far away from [her] mother as possible\"), and the couple honeymoon in Venice. They travel on to Walter's medical post in Shanghai, where he is stationed in a government lab studying infectious diseases. They find themselves ill-suited, with Kitty much more interested in parties and the social life of the British expatriates.\nKitty meets Charles Townsend (Liev Schreiber), a married British vice consul, and the two engage in a clandestine affair. When Walter discovers his wife's infidelity, he seeks to punish her by threatening to divorce her on the grounds of adultery, if she doesn't accompany him to a small village in a remote area of China. He has volunteered to treat victims of an unchecked cholera epidemic sweeping through the area. Kitty begs to be allowed to divorce him quietly, but he refuses, stating \"Why should I put myself through the smallest trouble for you?\" She hopes Townsend will leave his wife Dorothy and marry her. When she proposes this possibility to Charles, he declines to accept, despite earlier claiming to love Kitty.\nShe is compelled to travel to the mountainous inland region with her husband. They embark upon an arduous, two-week-long overland journey, which would be considerably faster and much easier if they traveled by river, but Walter is determined to make Kitty as unhappy and uncomfortable as possible. Upon their arrival in Mei-tan-fu, she is distressed to discover they will be living in near squalor, far removed from everyone except their cheerful neighbor Waddington, a British deputy commissioner living with a young Chinese woman in relative opulence.\nWalter and Kitty barely speak to each other and, except for a cook and a Chinese soldier assigned to guard her, she is alone for long hours. After visiting an orphanage run by a group of French nuns, Kitty volunteers her services, and she is assigned to work in the music room. She is surprised to learn from the Mother Superior that her husband loves children, especially babies. In this setting, she begins to see him in a new light as she learns what a selfless and caring person he can be. When he sees her with the children, he in turn realizes she is not the shallow, selfish person he thought her to be. As Walter's anger and Kitty's unhappiness subside, their marriage begins to blossom in the midst of the epidemic crisis. She soon learns she is pregnant, but is unsure who the father is. Walter â in love with Kitty again â assures her it doesn't matter.\nThe cholera epidemic takes many victims. As Walter and the locals are starting to get it under control, completely due to his importation of clean water through a system of aqueducts (as the local people did not understand water-borne infectious disease[2][betterÂ sourceÂ needed]) cholera carrying refugees from elsewhere pour into the area, forcing Walter to set up a camp outside town. He contracts the disease and Kitty lovingly nurses him, but he dies, and she is devastated. Bereft and pregnant, she leaves China.\nFive years later, Kitty appears well-dressed and happy in London shopping with her young son Walter. They meet Townsend by chance on the street, and he suggests that Kitty meet with him. Asking young Walter his age, he realizes from the reply that he might have been the boy's father. Kitty rejects his overtures and walks away. When her son asks who Townsend is, she replies \"No one important, darling\".\n",

          "context": "\n\nThe police must investigate a series of robberies along a strip of land in the city. The new mayor of the city (Kenneth Mars) assigns Captain Harris (G.W. Bailey) and Lt. Proctor (Lance Kinsey) to the case, but while on stakeout the Wilson gang manages to slip through their fingers.The Mayor wants Harris and Proctor to work with Police Academy head Commandant Lassard (George Gaynes) on apprehending the gang. Lassard assembles a seven-man team consisting of Hightower (Bubba Smith), Tackleberry (David Graf), Jones (Michael Winslow), Hooks (Marion Ramsey), Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), Fackler (Bruce Mahler), and Lassard's nephew, Nick (Matt McCoy) who transfers from Miami (in the previous film Police Acdemy 5) to the city to remain close to his friends and dull-witted uncle.After distributing flyers as to the information of the Wilson gang and getting nowhere, Nick McCoy stumbles upon a paper heading of an antique diamond heading to a museum, and gets an idea to use it as bait: however the robbers nab the diamond anyway by cutting a hole in the truck and escaping through the sewer system. McCoy then decides to go undercover to get information regarding a possible hideout, but Harris decides to go undercover to get a confession.It turns out that Harris goes undercover as a window washer at a tall building, for which he has a fear of heights, and gets a confession of himself on tape after his loyal but numb-skull lacky, Proctor, accidentally knocks him over the balcony.It is revealed here that the robberies are committed by a group of three dim-witted criminals who do not seem to be able to do this on their own, and it is revealed they are being guided by a literally shadow figure known as the \"Mastermind\", who speaks to the three behind a wall of glass and uses a voice distortion device. He devises a plan to get the cops out of the way.Commandant Lassard and his men are later suspended after stolen jewellery from the last robbery is planted in Lassard's locker, pending an investigation. The misfit cops decide to clear Lassard's name by nabbing the gang and the ringleader. Accessing data files from a computer, McCoy deduces that the robberies are occurring along a bus route, thus intentionally lowering property values in that part of the city. They also learn that someone must be 'leaking' information to the bad guys, which is why they are always one step ahead of the Police Academy.The Police Academy force finds and does battle with the Wilson gang, while Nick chases the leader. A pursuit follows, which leads to Commissioner Hurst's (George Robertson) office. It is revealed that the Mayor is the \"Mastermind\" and that Captain Harris has been unwittingly leaking information during his daily meetings with the Mayor. Hurst apologizes and reinstates the force, and a plaque is given to honor the officers' bravery the next day.As the movie closes, Harris is sitting in a chair when a string tying the balloon float is cut, lifting his chair and floating him up into the air as he shouts Proctor's name.\n\n",

          "context": "\n\nThe film begins some years in the future from this exact moment. We see ads everywhere (buildings, walls, bus stops, e.t.c) for the hit game Slayers, and how the star character Kable (Gerard Butler) has four battles left before he earns his freedom. We are then shown a battle in progress: a massive shootout inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters get points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17-year-old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays/controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Afterward, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, since he now only has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don't believe that anyone will be released from the game.The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next guest for the show - genius recluse Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can get paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no one has ever survived that long). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre-engineered actions to do, and will be set free if they survive just one battle, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high). Also, the games are all televised on pay-per-view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano-cells implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning after the game is over, they get their control back).After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that eventually we will all be his slaves if we continue down this road. Castle gets a kick out of it and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape but in the end, he fails. Kable sits by himself and thinks about his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Kable. He talks about how Kable spooks everyone else when he sits by himself and is constantly thinking. He can't believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him why he's in prison. Kable has a quick flashback of a man bleeding in a room. Later on, while sitting in his cell, someone opens the slot of the door and hands Kable a picture of his wife and child. The female voice on the other side knows that his family is the only thing he fights for. She makes Kable sign an autograph for her son, David, and then takes a blood sample from his hand as proof of authenticity to increase the value of the autograph.Elsewhere, we see Kable's wife Angie (Amber Valletta) going to work as a character in Society. Practically all the game characters are dressed in ridiculous and skimpy costumes",

          "context": "Early one morning, a taxi pulls up at Tiffany &amp; Co. on Fifth Avenue in New York City, from which elegantly dressed Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) emerges. After looking into the shop's windows, she strolls home. Outside her apartment, she fends off Sid Arbuck (Claude Stroud), her date from the disastrous night before. Later, she is awakened by new neighbor Paul Varjak (George Peppard), ringing her doorbell to get into the building. The pair chat as she dresses to leave for her weekly visit to Sally Tomato (Alan Reed), a mobster incarcerated at Sing Sing prison. Tomato's lawyer, O'Shaughnessy, pays her $100 a week to deliver \"the weather report\".\n\n\n\n\nAudrey Hepburn as Holly Golightly\nAs she is leaving for Sing Sing, Holly is introduced to Paul's \"decorator\", wealthy older woman Emily Eustace Failenson (Patricia Neal), whom Paul nicknames \"2E\". That night, Holly goes out onto the fire escape to elude an over-eager date (Mel Blanc). She peeks into Paul's apartment and sees 2E leaving money and kissing Paul goodbye. After 2E leaves, Holly enters Paul's apartment and learns that he is a writer who has not had anything published since a book of vignettes five years before. Holly, in turn, explains that she is trying to save money to support her brother Fred when he gets out of the Army. The pair fall asleep, but are awakened when Holly has a nightmare about Fred. She later buys Paul a typewriter ribbon to apologize and invites him to a party at her apartment. There, Paul meets her Hollywood agent, O. J. Berman (Martin Balsam), who describes Holly's transformation from country girl into Manhattan socialite. He is also introduced to JosÃ© da Silva Pereira (JosÃ© Luis de Vilallonga), a wealthy Brazilian politician, and Rusty Trawler (Stanley Adams), the \"ninth richest man in America under 50.\"\nIn the days that follow, Paul and Holly become closer. One day, 2E enters Paul's apartment, worried that she is being followed. Paul tells her that he will investigate and eventually confronts Doc Golightly (Buddy Ebsen), Holly's estranged husband. Doc explains that Holly's real name is Lula Mae Barnes. They married when she was 13, and he wants to take her back to Texas, as Fred will be returning. After Paul reunites Holly and Doc, she tells Paul the marriage was annulled. At the bus station, she tells Doc she is not going with him. Doc leaves broken-hearted.\nAfter drinking at a club, Paul and Holly return to her apartment, where she drunkenly tells him that she plans to marry Trawler for his money. A few days later, Paul learns that one of his short stories will be published. On the way to tell Holly, he sees a newspaper headline stating that Trawler has married someone else. Holly and Paul agree to spend the day together, taking turns doing things that each has never done before. At Tiffany's, Paul has the ring from Doc Golightly's box of Cracker Jack engraved as a present for Holly. After spending the night together, he awakens to find her gone. When 2E arrives, Paul ends their relationship. She calmly accepts, having earlier concluded that he and Holly are in love.\nHolly schemes to marry JosÃ© for his money, which angers Paul. After Holly receives a telegram notifying her of Fred's death, she trashes her apartment. Months later, Paul has moved out. He is invited to dinner by Holly, who is leaving the next morning for Brazil to continue her relationship with JosÃ©. However, they are arrested in connection with Sally Tomato's drug ring, and Holly spends the night in jail.\nThe next morning, Holly is released on bail and finds Paul waiting, and they take a cab. He has her cat and a letter from JosÃ© explaining he must end their relationship due to her arrest. Holly insists she will go to Brazil anyway, asks the cab to pull over, and releases the ",

Alighting from the cab they tip the driver generously, bribing him to not say anything to anyone about them. Alice and Judson check the departure sign for The Silver Queen, heading for Panama City, Panama, and seem excited and anxious.Also waiting for the same flight is Peggy Nolan, to whom a delivery of expensive flowers is made with a card thanking her for some favor. Peggy disdainfully tosses the card in the trash and gives the flowers to a woman selling cheap gardenias.Soon after, the flight gets ready to leave and we are introduced to Professor and Mrs. Spengler, an elderly couple, and Joe, the flight's co-pilot, who is immediately attracted to Alice. Mrs. Spengler is a domineering woman, but her husband seems content to be bossed around like a child.As they wait on the tarmac near the 'plane a car drives up and a well dressed man emerges with a young boy and another man. The boy is Tommy and he is being sent away with \"Uncle\" Pete until his father -- a mobster -- can follow later.As the passengers board, Bill, the pilot, receives word that they will be transporting an anarchist back to Panama, but he assures the group there is nothing to worry about since the man will be in custody during the flight.\nThe prisoner is Vasquez, and is being accompanied by a bounty hunter named Crimp.After Larry the steward helps everyone get settled, the flight departs with its twelve souls aboard. Bill and Joe discuss plans for the layover and Joe indicates he has an interest in Alice. He goes back to the passenger compartment where beds have been made up and people are turning in for the night -- except for Crimp who plans to stay up and make sure Vasquez doesn't \"go for a walk\" -- thus cheating the hangman and himself out of $5,000.Pete tucks his young charge in for the night and helps him say his prayers (something Pete is unfamiliar with). Peggy comes up to the cockpit to visit with Bill, whose rudeness finally makes it clear that he wants nothing to do with her. When Alice rings for the steward, Joe takes the call and makes a play for her.Next morning the 'plane arrives for a refueling stop in Mexico and the passengers have breakfast. Joe continues to pursue Alice, under the assumption that she is Judson's secretary. Peggy makes another stab at getting Bill to warm to her and is rebuffed again. Then Pete tells her that her help isn't needed when she tries to get Tommy to drink his milk. Peggy's been \"marked\" as a loose woman by her fellow travelers who want nothing to do with her.Before boarding the 'plane a reporter confronts Judson and Alice and Joe learns that she is engaged to her \"boss\" and they are eloping.As the flight continues and heads into stormy weather the Professor discusses the methods by which a South American tribe of headhunters practice their craft. The conversation is interrupted by a news bulletin which recounts how Tommy's father has been killed. Peggy again tries to help with Tommy, saying \"he needs a woman.\" But Pete is still being judgemental and answers \"he needs a lady.\" Mrs. Spengler intervenes and comforts Tommy.As the storm they are flying through gets rougher, the passengers strap themselves into their seats and Crimp insists the pilots turn back. As the 'plane rocks back and forth a couple of metal cylinders break loose and crash through the back door. Tommy comes perilously close to going out the door when Llarry saves him and hands him to Pete. Just then the 'plane dips sharply and Larry is tossed out the door to his death. As Joe and Bill try to steady the 'plane Crimp tries to force them to turn back by waving his gun at them. In the struggle the gun goes off and is picked up by Vasquez.With a damaged engine the Silver Queen crashes, and all eleven on board survive. The next morning Joe and Bill admit to the professor that they were blown off ",

          "context": "\n\nThe film depicts the construction and ultimate demolition of a metaphorical wall. Though the film's symbolism is open to interpretation, the wall itself clearly reflects a sense of isolation and alienation.Pink (Bob Geldof), the protagonist (and unreliable narrator) of the film, is a rock star, one of several reasons behind his apparent depressive and detached emotional state. He is first seen in a quiet hotel room, having trashed it. The opening music is not by Pink Floyd, but is the Vera Lynn recording of \"The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot\". During the following scenes, it is revealed that Pink's father, a British soldier, was killed in action during World War II during Pink's infancy. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters' real-life father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who died in combat in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in February 1944.The movie then flashes back to Pink as a young English boy growing up in the early 1950s. Throughout his childhood, Pink longs for a father figure after he learns his father died in the war. At school, he is humiliated by his mean and stern teacher for writing poems in class. The poems that the teacher seizes from him and reads aloud are lyrics from \"Money\" from the Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon. Pink is also affected by his overprotective mother who spoils him by giving him whatever he wants.As an adult, Pink eventually gets married as his fame as a rock star grows, but he and his wife grow apart and she has an affair while Pink is on tour. When Pink learns of the affair, he compensates with expensive materialistic possessions and turns to a willing groupie (Jenny Wright), whom he brings back to his hotel room only to trash it in a fit of violence, causing her to flee the room in terror.Pink slowly begins to lose his mind to metaphorical \"worms\". He shaves off all of his body hair (an incident inspired by former bandmate Syd Barrett, who appeared at a 1975 recording session of Wish You Were Here, having shaved his eyebrows and body hair) and, while watching The Dam Busters on television, morphs into his neo-Nazi alter-ego. Pink's manager (Bob Hoskins), along with the hotel manager (Michael Ensign) and some paramedics, break into the hotel room and discover Pink. They take him away into a waiting limousine outside the hotel and inject him with drugs to enable him to perform.The drugs cause Pink to hallucinate and he fantasises that he is a neo-Nazi dictator, his concert is a rally. His followers proceed to attack ethnic minorities and rape the white girlfriend of a black man. Later, Pink holds a rally in suburban London, singing \"Waiting for the Worms\". The scene is inter-cut by images of animated marching hammers that goose-step across ruins.Pink screams \"Stop!\" and takes refuge in a bathroom stall at the concert venue, reciting poems which would later be used as lyrics on Pink Floyd's \"Your Possible Pasts\" from The Final Cut album and \"5:11 AM (The Moment Of Clarity)\" from Roger Waters' The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking.In a climatic animated sequence, Pink puts himself on trial. He is depicted as a small, pink rag doll that rarely moves. The judge is a giant pair of buttocks, with two backward facing legs, an anus for a mouth and a scrotum for a chin. The lawyer is a tall, menacing, vulturelike man and the schoolmaster is an abusive, hateful marionette. After hearing from the parties and witnesses (Pink's wife and mother), the judge orders the wall to be torn down. The wall explodes and shows a montage of events from the entire film.The film concludes with three children cleaning up a pile of debris after an earlier riot. It is unknown whatever has happened to Pink, leaving the viewer to decide.\n\n",

Riddled with grief over the death of her husband, bound by nightmares and void of all emotions beyond hate and sorrow, Stella (Kiele Sanchez) has spent the past months traveling the world, trying to convince others that vampires exist in this world.Constantly feeling as though she is being hunted, Stella is well aware the impending threat on her life, the death of her husband Eben having taken from her her ability to feel emotions, leaving her feeling cold and empty inside. Following instructions from a mysterious man named Dane, she eventually ends up in Los Angeles.One night, while giving a lecture to an audience of people with whom she hopes to convince that vampires exist and aware that they attend when she speaks, she activates overhead ultraviolet lamps that incinerate several of the vampires in the audience before the humans. She is quickly arrested and harassed by a man named FBI Agent Norris whom she quickly learns that he is a 'familiar' (bug-eater) one of the many thousands of human followers of the vampires all over the world, placed to keep their activities covered up. After they release her from custody with a warning to keep quiet about the existence of vampires, she returns to her hotel room to find three people waiting for her; Paul (Rhys Coiro), Amber (Diora Baird) and Todd (Harold Perrineau) who had been sent by Dane to collect her in order to hunt down the vampire queen Lilith, whom they are convinced once out of the way, the vampires will fall into more-or-less form of dormancy as she is responsible for their every move and for keeping them hidden, when Stella asks if she is responsible for the incident at Barrow and is notified that she was. She is taken to meet Dane (Ben Cotton) and is shocked to discover that he too is a vampire, though due to a superficially inflicted wound he has maintained a grasp of humanity, only drinking blood from packaged hospital stocks he keeps.At first hesitant to join in on a plan to attack a vampire nest, Paul eventually convinces Stella to join them, telling her of his daughter being killed by one and his accusations of a vampire killing her resulting in a divorce with his wife.The following day, the four of them find their way to a vampire's nest and they are ambushed by a group of them. In the attempt to flee, Todd is bitten and turns after they lock themselves in a cellar room. When Paul hesitates, Stella manages to kill him by smashing in his head with a cinder block. They decide to wait for night when the vampires go out to feed in order to make their escape.After night falls, Dane comes and frees them, on their way out they capture a vampire. Taking him back to their base of operations, Dane interrogates the non-English speaking animalistic vamp with ultraviolet lamps, eventually following him back to another nest. They invade the nest and rescue a human they were using as a feeding station and with her memories of Lilith's lair aboard one of the ships on the bay they are able to plan an attack on her directly.At Dane's place, Stella and Paul get intimate and have sex. Meanwhile, Lilith (Mia Kirshner) decides that Agent Norris should prove his worth to become a vampire (in order to cure throat or lung cancer he has been suffering from) and he bites the neck of a captive girl, named Stacey (Katharine Isabelle), drinking her blood until dead. Afterward she turns him to hunt Stella and the others.Dane is killed when Norris arrives, and the others flee with the survivor from the nest, they travel to a boat yard and Jennifer points out the boat that they are set to sail to Alaska in for another 30 day feeding period. They tell Jennifer to leave and the three of them stowaway on the ship and discover that vampires can be resurrected after death if their corpses are fed human blood. They eventually confront the human captain who says ",

They leave Thumbelina alone on a lily pad in order to fetch a priest, but a friendly swallow, Jacquimo (the narrator of the film), overhears Thumbelina's cries for help and frees her. Jacquimo's friends, the jitterbugs, promise to help Thumbelina get home safely while Jacquimo sets off to find Cornelius. Meanwhile, Cornelius learns of Thumbelina's kidnapping and ventures out to find her.\nWhile trying to get home, Thumbelina is ambushed by Berkeley Beetle, who scares the jitterbugs away. He is enamoured with her singing, and promises to show her the way home if she sings at his Beetle Ball first. Thumbelina agrees, but when she's received poorly at the Beetle Ball, Beetle kicks her out without helping her.\nWinter is approaching. Jacquimo accidentally impales his wing on a thorn and is knocked out by the cold, while Cornelius falls into a lake and is frozen in ice. Grundel, who is searching for Thumbelina, finds Beetle and discovers she is in love with Prince Cornelius and upon some convincing from Beetle, decides to find and kidnap Cornelius to lure Thumbelina to him. Grundel forces Beetle to help him as Grundel steals his wings and won't return them until Beetle has found and captured Cornelius.\nThumbelina is taken in by Miss Fieldmouse, who tells her that Cornelius has died. The two visit Miss Fieldmouse's neighbor, Mr. Mole who tells them about a dead bird he found in his tunnel earlier that day. It turns out to be Jacquimo, who Thumbelina discovers to be only unconscious. Mr. Mole wishes to marry Thumbelina; heartbroken over Cornelius's death, Thumbelina accepts. Jacquimo awakens under Thumbelina's care and leaves to find Cornelius, refusing to believe that he is dead. Meanwhile, Beetle brings Cornelius's frozen body to Grundel and informs him that Thumbelina is going to marry the Mole. After the two leave to stop the wedding, the young jitterbugs thaw Cornelius's body out.\nAt the wedding, Thumbelina realizes at the last moment that she can't marry someone she does not love and refuses to take the vows. Grundel and Beetle crash the wedding, but Thumbelina flees from them and Mr. Mole. Cornelius intercepts the crowd and confronts Grundel, the ensuing fight resulting in them both falling into an abyss. Once outside and free, Thumbelina is reunited with Jacquimo, who takes her to Cornelius' kingdom, the Vale of the Fairies. Cornelius appears, having survived the fall, the pair are reunited, and Thumbelina accepts his proposal of marriage. The two kiss, and Thumbelina is granted her own wings.\nWith Thumbelina's mother and the fairy court in attendance, Thumbelina and Cornelius are married and depart on their honeymoon on Cornelius's bumblebee. Images shown during the credits reveal that Beetle resumed his singing career and had gotten his wings back, Ms. Fieldmouse married Mr. Mole, and Grundel also survived the fall with minor injuries and married a female toad (implying that he lost interest in Thumbelina).\n",
