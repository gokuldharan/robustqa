          "context": "If you are a traditional traveler who believes that cameras are irreplaceable, there are a few things to keep in mind when looking for the perfect camera. Sensor size Along with the megapixel count, the size of the sensor determines the overall image quality as well as the performance of the camera in low light. It also determines if the camera can electronically place the details it captures electronically to see. This makes the photos not clear enough to see when you see the photos on a larger screen. Portability \"The most important thing is that the camera is not too big or heavy, and that you have a good zoom range for wide-angle and telephoto shots,\" Atherton told CNN. A good choice is a slim, lightweight business camera with a highly qualified built-in optical zoom. \" It's very popular for travel because it's light but built with a tele-lens that can magnify up to 60 times, '' Atherton said. Zoom and shutter Speed is an important factor for action or shot recordings. \" If you're dealing with something active - wildlife or people working on the street - faces change in a matter of seconds, 'Arnold said,' a fast shutter speed is useful for taking the hundreds of photos that you need that single win hold.

I tried a few days ago to enter an elevator with one of my arms stuck in a bandage while carrying a computer bag in the other. Because I was not fast enough, two young people passed me who could climb into the elevator in front of me. The elevator door only closes after I enter. The young people had already pressed their desired floor button and were impatiently waiting for me to press the button I was heading to. If they had decided to help, we would have been able to move much faster. But they did not. So I did my best and pressed the button with my arm. The two young people seemed very angry with me. I lost heart. The memory of this incident stayed with me because it followed shortly after the guard of my building refused to help me carry a heavy box full of books. His answer was that he could not carry the books a few meters because that was not his job. However, I remembered helping people carry boxes, shopping bags, or wheelchairs for so many years at the request of a stranger in need or when my conscience called me. \" Oh, this young generation, they have no manners, 'my grandmother would say.

          "context": "Where do dogs come from? Gray wolves are their ancestors. Scientists are pretty consistent about it. And researchers have suggested that dogs' origins may date from Europe, the Near East, Siberia and southern China. Central Asia is the newest and best candidate, according to a large study of dogs from around the world. Laura M. Shannon and Adam R. Boyko at Cornell University, and an international group of other scientists, have studied not only purebred dogs, but also street or village dogs. Dr. Shannon analyzed three different types of DNA, said dr. Boyko said, the first time this has been done for such a large and diverse group of dogs from 38 countries. And this led them to Central Asia as the place of dogs in the same way that genetic studies have found the origins of modern humans in East Africa. Dr. Boyko says the analysis pointed to Central Asia as the place where \"all the dogs that live today\" come from. The data did not allow the exact dating of the origin, but he showed that it took place at least 15,000 years ago. Greger Larson of Oxford University, who is leading a major international effort to dissect ancient DNA from fossilized bones, said he was impressed by the study. \" 'It's really amazing to see not only the number of stray dogs, but also the geographical latitude and the number of remote locations where the dogs have been selected,' he said in an email. He also praised the sampling of different types of DNA and the analytical methods. Dr. Larson, who was not involved in the study, said he believed the finding in Central Asia should be further tested. He said he suspected that the origins of modern dogs were 'extremely messy' and that no sampling of live populations would be definitive. He said a combination of studies of modern and ancient DNA is needed.",

She was so determined that she kept school and gave music lessons to get money for the school expenses. In 1849, after graduating from medical school, she decided to continue her studies in Paris. She wanted to become a surgeon, but a serious eye problem forced her to give up the idea. Upon her return to the United States, she found it difficult to start her own practice because she was a woman.

One meaning is that someone who never sits in one place will not be successful. The other is that someone who is always moving, without roots in one place, avoids responsibilities. This proverb was first used in the 1500s. But in the 1960s, the term 'rolling stone' gained notoriety in the world of rock-and-roll music. It became the name of a song, a rock band and a magazine. Experts say it all started with a song by American singer and guitarist Muddy Waters. He was one of the country's leading blues musicians until his death in 1983. His music has influenced singers such as Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. In 1950, Muddy Waters recorded a song called 'Rolling Stone'. A British rock band is said to have taken its name from the song by Muddy Waters. The Rolling Stones first performed in 1962. The members of the group call themselves 'the world's largest rock-and-roll orchestra'. In 1965, Bob Dylan released his song 'Like a Rolling Stone'. It is one of his most famous and influential works. It's a bad song about a woman who was once rich and successful. But now she is on her own, 'with no direction home, like an unknown, like a rolling stone'. In 1967, a young man named Jann Wenner started a magazine and called it 'Rolling Stone'. The magazine reported on rock music and the popular culture that the music created. By 1971, 'Rolling Stone' had become the leading publication for rock music and counterculture. It is still popular today.",

          "context": "Tobacco companies are fighting efforts in the United States and Australia to make their products less attractive. In Washington, a federal judge last week stopped the Food and Drug Administration from requiring new warning labels on cigarette packets. Judge Richard Leon ruled in a case brought by five tobacco companies. The judge has temporarily halted a new federal rule requiring new major warnings from September next. These include color1 images such as a dead body or diseased lungs. And simple text alerts appear now. Congress called for color1 images that show the dangers of smoking, similar to what Canada does. But the tobacco companies believe the new requirements approved in June violate their constitutional rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Judge Leon said the FDA could not need the new labels before a lawsuit was decided against the government. Some experts believe the process can take years. The judge said he believed the cigarette manufacturers were likely to win their case. He said the images should be designed to address emotions, and rejected the government's arguments that they should be purely factual. He accused the government of trying to use the labels to promote an \"obvious anti-smoking agenda\". The head of a group that does not smoke, the campaign for tobacco-free children, calls the ruling 'wrong in science and wrong in law'. About one-fifth of American adults smoke. The World Health Organization says tobacco kills nearly six million people worldwide each year. More than six hundred thousand of them are non-smokers who inhale other people's tobacco smoke. In Australia, tobacco companies want to stop being the world's most restrictive laws on cigarette advertising. Cigarettes could only be sold in regular olive green packaging. Only the brand name and health warnings could appear. The Senate approved the bill last week and returned it to the House of Representatives to approve minor amendments. The law will come into force in December next year. Tobacco companies say the legislation violates the Australian Constitution. They say it will illegally reduce the value of their brands and trademarks. Health Minister Nicola Roxon says the government is ready for a legal battle.",

This practice exists today as part of the process of testing candidates for the doctoral degree. Generally, however, modem exams are written.

Perhaps it arose with the great increase in population and the development of modern industry. A room full of candidates for a state exam precisely set up by electric clocks and carefully cared for by drivers looks like a group of workers at a car factory. Teachers and students are definitely expected to act like machines. One type of test is sometimes called an \"objective\" test. It is meant to deal with facts, not personal opinions. To set up an objective test, the teacher writes a series of questions, each with only one correct answer.

If we do not reduce each individual's need for water (directly and through enclosed water), the water situation will get worse. It is obvious that we can not increase the demand for water much more without adversely affecting the environment, society and the economy. It's too easy to blame someone else for the water situation - \"if 70% of the water is used for agriculture, then that's what we need to target\" - but it's not that easy. We are all dependent on the food and resources that agriculture provides, and while there are certainly opportunities to increase water efficiency on the farm, the solution will require more than that. We each share the responsibility for the sustainable management of our water resources, which means you need to use less water at home, at work, at school, on holiday, on the farm, ... everyone, everywhere and every time. It's time to dump her and move on. It involves re-evaluating our relationship with water and using it more sparingly. At the most basic level, it is a behavioral change, and the assignment of a value to water that reflects its value. We can also promote economic benefits of water conservation. There are many real-world examples in the case studies on this site. Everyone has the responsibility to save water if future generations want to enjoy a similar standard of living as we enjoy now. In fact, many of the consequences associated with water use are likely to affect our own lives! www.savewater.com.au is designed to help you meet the challenge of becoming water efficient.

          "context": "An annoying problem for people, who like to brag about all the distant planets and moons we have explored, is that we never looked pretty under our noses. The inside of the earth is relatively close, but how can we get there? The deepest oil well is only six kilometers deep in the crust (the center of the earth is about 4000 kilometers deeper). Russian scientists dug the deepest hole in Siberia, but their bottom was about 12 kilometers below the surface. The Mohole project, an American plan in the 1950s, required a hole to be drilled 25 miles to the boundary between the hard rocks of the crust and the soft mantle. Unfortunately, the government supported support through the project. It is becoming increasingly difficult to drill deep into the earth as rocks become softer and softer. Hard but easily broken at the surface, rocks become plastic at depth, and the pressure caused by the weight of the overlying crust - about 52,800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles, makes further drilling impossible. The little we know about the inside of the earth (such as the fact that there is a crust, a mantle, and a nucleus) comes from indirect evidence, such as the analysis of earthquakes. It may be time for a thorough new method of exploring the inside of the earth. Scientist David Stevenson says we need to forget about drilling holes. Instead, we need to open a crack. Stevenson suggests digging a rift about a mile long, a width and a mile deep (not with a shovel), but with an explosion on the scale of a nuclear bomb. He then threw a few hundred thousand tons of molten iron into the crack with a robot. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, moves about 16 feet per second downward, carrying the robot with it, opening the crack deeper and deeper. The mass of iron would drop about a week and 2000 miles to the outer edge of the earth's core, and the robot would send data to the surface. Stevenson compares his idea to the exploration of space. \" \"We're going somewhere we haven't been yet,\" he says. There will most likely be surprises. ' This idea can probably be put in the drawer marked with Is not going to happen. The robot will have to survive temperatures that will melt just about everything. But Stevenson's idea may give a new look at an old problem. Great things can come from impossible ideas.",

A lot of research has been done on what happens to someone's feelings when they are asked to wear only one color1 clothing. It has been proven that if we wear specific colors of clothing, it can change our feelings. Suppose we feel sad, and if we wear black, we may feel worse. However, if we wear green, red or yellow, we can start to feel better. It is said that each color1 has its own healing power.

Next academic year, term 1 will therefore be as always: sentences in paragraph. And term 2 will contribute to the drafting of five paragraphs. The last three weeks of term 2 are reserved to set up writing for TOEFL and CEE. If the students had done their job correctly by that time, they should be able to write well. As for the Latin course, I will be posting notices on campus next week so that students will understand what is being offered before I introduce the course. A number of students have already emailed me about the course. I'm sure you do not understand how important it is to open this program at our school. People around the world are interested in what we plan to do. There are many benefits available to students who are successful with the course. Share what I said with the administration. I want them to understand the importance of this course. The reason I contacted these colleagues (actually Oxford contacted me) is that I have confidence in our students and in myself. I know that when the professors meet our students and hear them speak and read Latin, they will be amazed. It will open all kinds of doors for students that they never even thought of knocking on.

Going to a bar with friends is always enjoyable in slightly different ways. On the other hand, a table can sometimes give us very positive experiences as well. I just moved from New York City to suburban Pennsylvania. It was quite a pace change, with positive and negative aspects. One of the best aspects is that I spend more time outside. I really enjoy staying outside, especially eating out. I had the goal of eating outside as often as possible this summer, and one of my first purchases for the new home was a table and a set of chairs for the garden. Is my garden table something or an experience? This is clearly a thing and yet it makes the experience possible to eat outside. I love eating out, so my garden table is one of my favorite purchases ever. Therefore, I find the dividing line between things and experiences more nuanced than at first glance. To be happy, however, the most important thing is what kind of purchases you have made. Sometimes we may all have purchases that look like a waste of money like probably half of the clothes in our closets, but how does that happen? ' There are many reasons why this happens. The biggest is that we spend a lot of our time earning money to buy things. The problem is that we buy a lot of things that we do not really need. There is nothing worse than looking in your closet and realizing how many hours you worked to buy things you never wear. But what about a table with which you can be outside in the summer?

          "context": "According to a study published on Tuesday, a third of elementary school children in China suffer from psychological ill health due to stress in the classroom. The problem is so serious that urgent measures are needed, warns the study led by British and Chinese researchers. The survey examined 2,191 students from nine to 12 years old in nine schools in Zhejiang, a prosperous coastal province in eastern China. Eighty-one percent of young people said they were \"very\" worried about exams, 63 percent were afraid of being punished by their teacher, 44 percent were at least sometimes physically bullied - with boys likely to be victims as girls - and 73 percent percent were physically punished by their parents. Most children have complained that they are struggling to cope with the amount of homework they have been given. More than one-third reported headaches or abdominal pain - psychosomatic symptoms of stress - at least once a week. The children who were most stressed reported the occurrence of aches or pains four times a week. The study, led by Therese Hesketh, a professor at the University College London (UCL) Center for International Health and Development, pointed to the extreme competitiveness in China's education system, from primary school. \" The competitive and punitive educational environment leads to high levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms, \"the authors say. Measures to reduce unnecessary stress on children in schools need to be put in place as a matter of urgency. ' The article appears in Archives of Disease in Childhood, a journal of the British Medical Association (BMA). The \"urban\" area for the study was Hangzhou, the provincial capital of Zhejiang, while the \"rural\" area was a poor province in the province of Quzhou, in the west of the province. The study highlights some of the complexities that explain the demands for academic excellence and intolerance of failure. One factor is the country's dramatic increase in wealth, which has created 'unprecedented opportunities for upward mobility' and in turn has put pressure on children to do well in school. Other reasons are China's one-child policy and the Confucian traditions of respect for parents and older people, piety, obedience and discipline. \" \"The aspirations of many parents, who themselves had limited educational opportunities, are now being invested in their only children,\" it is said. Previous studies on school-related stress and its impact on health are few and usually come from Scandinavia. A 2008 evaluation among 10- to 13-year-olds in Sweden found that 21 percent of boys out of 30 percent of girls experience headaches, and 17 percent of boys and 28 percent of girls experience at least once a week abdominal pain.",

According to the survey, the Olympics not only built up the image of China, but also an advertisement for China's tourism. The online survey was conducted on consumers in 16 countries and regions before the Games opened and closed. About 80 percent of the respondents were not in China before the events, and 50 percent of them expressed the hope of visiting China after the Games. According to the survey, 70 percent of respondents felt that Beijing was more modern and scientific than they thought. The most interested respondents were from Singapore, India, Mexico, South Africa and the Republic of Korea, as well as China's Hong Kong and Taiwan. Pan Wen, head of Chinese tourism research at the Nielson Company, said the World Tourism Organization predicts that China will become the world's largest tourist attraction annually with 137 million foreign tourists. \" \"This figure would have been achieved earlier with the help of the Beijing Olympics,\" said Pan.",

          "context": "An Australian inventor has designed and built an environmentally friendly ferry that uses solar and wind power to transport people to Sydney Harbor. Robert Dane and his Solar Sailor recently received the award for the Australian Design Awards. The Solar Sailor has been in use for six months. It uses four energy sources for their power - solar power, wind, battery power with stored solar energy and an in-store fuel generator, all controlled by computers. The ferry can move only 7.5 knots on just wind and solar power. These are solar wings and fiberglass solar panels that not only absorb sunlight and store in batteries, but also serve as sails. \" We show our solar panels in two planes with the sun, which increases the amount of energy we get from the sun by 40 percent, \"says Dane. And also we can use the same structure to do another job, that's the sail too, and so these wing sails actually push the ferry just like a soft sail. ' Computers look at the sun and the wind and turn the sun wings into the corner to take in most of the sunlight. If there is not much wind or a cloudy day, the energy stored in the batteries can run the electric motor for up to five hours. \" If the batteries are too low, the computer turns on the generator so that the boat is always able to meet a commercial schedule, or to get from point A to point B, no matter what, 'Dan explains. Dane got his idea for the Solar Sailor from a book on insects. He was amazed at how insects used their wings to gather solar energy to warm themselves. \" When I read it, I realized that there is a good example in nature for what we are going to do, namely to use a solar wing to collect solar energy and also to sail, 'he says.",

Carnival celebrations are believed to have originated in the Feast of Saturnalia, which, adapted to Christianity, has become a farewell to bad things in a season of religious discipline to repent and prepare for Christ's death and to to come alive again. Modern Brazilian carnival dates from Rio de Janeiro in 1641. It originally copied the European form of the festival and later incorporated elements of American and African cultures. In the late 19th century, the strings were introduced in Rio de Janeiro. These were group competitions that parade on instruments and dance through city roads. Today, they are known as blocks, consisting of a group of people wearing costumes or special T-shirts with themes or logos. Blocks are usually associated with particular neighborhoods; it includes both a music group and many performers. Block parades have become an expressive feature of Rio's Carnival. Today, they number more than 100 and the groups increase every year. Blocks can be formed by small or large groups of revealers with a clear title. Before the show, they gather in a square and then parade in parts of the city, often near the beach. Carnival time in Rio is very interesting, but it is also the most expensive time to visit Rio. Hotel rooms and other accommodation can be up to four times more expensive than the regular rates. There are large crowds in some places and life is very normal in many parts of the city.",

An argument is made that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device, the BRICs, really should be the BICs. \" Is Russia really worth the name BRICs? ' asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreigh Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of The Russian Balance State, believes that Putin and Medvedev's Russia are simply not worthy of joining Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic powerhouses. . He writes: 'The country's economic performance has dropped to such a low level that one has to ask whether it has any say in the world economy, compared to the other members of its group. I have just returned from Moscow, which is always dull during this season. Over the past seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state lives on oil and gas. \" Economically, Aslund has the figures on his side. The International Monetary Fund estimates that the Russian economy will decline by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow by 8.5 percent and India by 5.4 percent. There is less of a case for Brazil, with a drop of 0.7 percent, but it is still faring much better than Russia. But the BRICs are not just about economics. As mentioned above, it is a marketing tool to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment point of view, it can be argued that Russia leads the BRICs. The stock market has risen 128 percent this year, up from about 80 percent for the other three. At the very least, Russia's economic underperformance and conviction on the stock do indicate that it is indeed one of the group.",

          "context": "Many parents try hard to protect their children from TV and internet advertising. But how can you protect a child from a large fast food advertisement painted on her school closet? Or a toy ad on the side of his school bus? As school budgets shrink, a growing number of schools in the United States sell advertising space on lockers and buses and in gyms or cafeterias. It's an easy way for schools to make money. And advertising can provide relief for parents who are exhausted by making cash donations to support schools. Although parents can always turn off the televisions or computers, they cannot continue to advertise at schools. This is not the first time the problem has surfaced. A news program for teens, for example, has been criticized for including ads in the 12-minute broadcasts in the classroom. And parent groups have successfully pushed for a plan by a company called Bus Radio to put music and commercials on school buses. But now things are different. Just last month, Los Angeles approved a plan to have companies advertise in the district's schools. Officials say the plan could provide as much as $ 18 million for the schools. In St. Francis, Minn., Schools recently agreed to cover 10% to 15% of their boxes with advertisements. Time says. Edward Saxton, a teacher at the school, says: 'So far parents are accepting this as a way to raise the necessary money. The money pays for programs like arts, sports and music. Parents do not like to have programs cut off. Me neither. Besides, schools are constantly thinking about the effects on children. ' However, Susan Linn, an educator, says: 'Children have seen enough advertisements on TV, in magazines and the products they use daily. School is not a place for advertising at all. ' Readers, what about you? Would you rather help with another fundraiser from the school, or expose your child to advertisements in boxes and buses? Is it worth it to keep tax ads out of schools, or to increase your own cash support for schools through donations?",

The Belgian-born sociologist, whose research interests also include counter-terrorism, international policing, crime control and internet technology, says he has seen Lady Gaga 30 times. \" We're going to see Lady Gaga as a social event, \"Prof Deflem told the USC Student Newspaper Daily Gamecock. So it's not the person, and it's not the music. It's more this thing in society that has 10 million followers on Facebook and six million on Twitter. I mean, it's a social phenomenon. \" It looks at business and marketing strategies, the role of old and new media, fans and live concerts, gay culture, religious and political themes, sex and sexuality, and the cities of New York and Hollywood. Prof Deflem said he initially intended to name the course the Sociology of Fame or the Sociology of Celebrity, and to use Lady Gaga as an example. Prof Deflem, also a fan of Frank Zappa, Prince, Led Zeppelin, Alice Cooper, Status Quo and Ritchie Blackmore, says his interest in Lady Gaga began when he first saw her appear on television on January 9, 2009. \" They do not have to be hardcore fans. The better fan will not necessarily be the better student. However, you should be a little interested in the topic. If you really do not like her, you should probably not follow the course. '",

The festival allows visitors to taste the best wines in Canada, along with unique dishes that represent the latest developments in local cuisine. The Montreal Jazz Festival comes alive every summer during the International Jazz Festival. The Festival International de Jazz de Montreal is an annual jazz festival held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The Montreal Jazz Fest held the Guinness World Record in 2004 as the largest jazz festival in the world. This year, the event will take place from June 29 to July 9. Stadiums replace cars along busy streets. With a large number of free outdoor performances, you will clap your fingers at anything from Dixieland to blues, African beats to modern trip-hop and everything in between. Are you ready? Just head east to the Newfoundland Targa Rally, which runs from September 9 to 16 this year. The 2200-kilometer race spans the eastern and central parts of the province and is the largest race of its kind in North America. On these sections, you race against the clock rather than other competitors. This is an excellent opportunity to test your car's limits and skills. Hello spring! In 1945, thousands of gifts of tulip bulbs from Holland were planted on the Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Canada. These gifts were a thank you to Canadian soldiers who helped liberate Holland in World War II. Since then, the capital has become home to the Canadian Tulip Festival. From May 4 to 22, Ottawa and Gatineau (a city in southwestern Quebec) will be covered with beautiful flowers. In addition to three million tulips, visitors can also attend concerts featuring some of Canada's brightest music stars.",

Plants grew from the roofs and in the courtyards trees grew. Today, the temple is the scene of a busy restoration program. A team of 15 Indian experts organizes a workforce of 400 Cambodians, mostly women who clean, repair and rebuild parts of this temple. As I walk through the courtyards, I notice that the Cambodian women spend hours carefully cleaning a small stone area. Plates are laid down to protect the precious painted stones while the repairs are in progress. There are very few machines and little heavy equipment. Workers carry building materials in buckets at the end of long poles. In the corner of the courtyard lie heaps of stones waiting to be replaced. Three Indian chemists oversee the cleaning of the stones. This is a very slow task. First, they clean the stones with brushes containing buckets of a weak chemical. Then gaps between the stones are filled. Finally, another material is painted on the stones that will protect it from water forever. Work begins every day at 7 p.m. m. and continue until late afternoon six days a week, with an afternoon break. After the departure of the tour groups, it is the best time to visit the temple. As the sun sets, shadows spread across the courtyard. After sunset the sky turns pink. The gray stone towers get a golden color before turning pink.

A good book can capture our attention so completely that we forget about our surroundings and even our identity for the time being. Reading good books is one of the greatest pleasures in life. It increases our satisfaction when we are cheerful, and reduces our problems when we are sad. Whatever our main purpose with reading, our contact with good books may never give us enjoyment and satisfaction. With a good book in our hands, we never have to be lonely. Whether the characters in it are taken from real life or are purely imaginary, they might become our companions and friends. On the pages with books we can walk with the wisdom and good of all lands and at all times. The people we meet in books may delight us because they seem to be very human friends who love us or because they offer unknown types that we would like to welcome as new acquaintances. Our human friends can bore us at times, but the friends we make in books never tire us out with their company. By turning the page, we can reject them without fear that they will hurt their feelings. As human friends leave us, good books are always ready to give us friendship, sympathy and encouragement. Of all the gifts from reading books, experience is the most important. Few of us can travel far from home or have a wide range of experiences, but we can all guide different books through the pages. Whether we want to escape from the seemingly boring realities of daily routine or whether we want to go to a distant place, a book will help us if nothing else can. To travel by book, we do not need a bank account to pay our money; no airship or sea vessel or streamline train to transport us; no passport to enter the land of our heart's desire. Through books we can get the danger of _ adventure without danger. We can climb high mountains, face the dangers of an Antarctic winter or cross the scorching desert sands, all without difficulty. In books we can visit the studios of Hollywood; we can mingle with the merry crowds of the Paris boulevards; we can go with the picturesque farmers in an Alpine village or the friendly natives on a South Sea island.

Grimsvotn is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Europe. What makes Grimsvotn different is that it lies under an ice glacier up to 12 meters thick. The hot volcano heats the ice above, which then forms a layer of water between the glacier and the volcano, which keeps it stable. As the water flows out from under the glacier, the pressure rises. The lava from the volcano then comes to the surface. This is exactly what is happening today. Now airlines have to change their flights so as not to fly through the clouds of volcanic ash. According to KLM, one of Europe's largest airlines, aircraft cannot go under the cloud or over it. Passing through the cloud can cause the aircraft's engines to jam and damage the aircraft. The eruption also caused problems for animals in Iceland. The volcano left ash and sharp, glassy rocks all over the countryside.

How do such pressure problems arise, and can they be reduced? Some researchers believe that we can find the answers through a more familiar system in which problems arise - road traffic flows. Martin Treiber, from the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, has previously developed models for traffic flow. One of the first attempts to model traffic flow was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his associate Gerard Whitham of the University of Manchester. They view the traffic as a kind of liquid flowing through a pipe and watch the flow change as the liquid becomes denser. Initially, the flow rate increases as the density increases, because you only get more things at the same time. But if the density becomes too high, there is a risk of jam, and the flow rate drops sharply. Treiber's model of a marathon uses the same principle that the flow rate first increases and then decreases as the density of runners increases, thanks to a sudden switch from free to pressurized. He assumes that there is a series of different preferred speeds for different runners, each maintaining during the race. With only these factors, Treiber can calculate the flow rate of runners, knowing that the \"carrying capacity\" is at every point on the route. This enables Treiber to find out how blocking may depend on the race conditions - for example for different starting procedures. Some marathons start by having all the runners leave at the same time (meaning the back has to wait until the front moves forward). Others give runners according to different skills to different groups and let them start in a series of waves. Treiber applied the model to the annual Rennsteig half marathon in Central Germany, which attracted about 6,000 participants. The traditional route had to be changed in 2013 because the police were no longer willing to close a road to ensure runners could drive safely. It can move over a 60 m wooden bridge or through a tunnel. Treiber used his model to predict the possible blockage in the various options. The model predicted that a mass start would run runners if the bridge were used. Only by moving the starting point further back from the bridge could the danger be avoided - and even then, if some of the numbers assumed in the model were just inaccurate, there was still a risk of jam at the bridge. On the other hand, there was no dangerous blockage to the tunnel route. The organizers of the management consulted Treiber's team and finally chose this option.",

Their study found that theobromine, found in cocoa, was nearly a third more effective at stopping cough than codeine, which is currently considered the best cough medicine. Researchers from Imperial College London, who published their findings online, said the discovery could lead to more effective cough treatment. \" Although cough is not necessarily harmful, it can have a major impact on quality of life, and this discovery could be a major step forward in treating this problem, 'said Professor Peter Barnes. Ten healthy volunteers received theobromine, codeine or placebo during the experiment, a pill containing no medicine. Neither the volunteers nor the researchers knew who got the pill. The researchers then measured levels of capsaicin, which is used in research to cause coughs and as a sign of how well the medicine stops coughing. The team found that when the volunteers received theobromine, the capsaicin needed to produce a cough was about a third higher than in the placebo group. When they were given codeine, they only needed slightly higher levers of capsaicin to cough compared to placebo. The researchers said that theobromine suppresses a nerve activity, which causes coughing. They also found that theobromine, unlike some standard cough treatments, does not cause any side effects such as drowsiness.",

          "context": "A house of cards? Sounds incredible, doesn 't it? Not if the architect is 31-year-old Bryan Berg. He made a career out of building fantastic map houses, stadiums, capitals, castles and the world's tallest map tower. How does he do it? Bryan's structures are incredible because they consist entirely of perfectly balanced, free-standing playing cards. He never uses glue, duct tape or anything else to hold the cards together. He also does not fold the cards. He discovered another way to make a strong house of cards using a trick from nature. To make plants strong, nature builds them with cells with hard walls. Rows and rows of these cells form a grid that helps leaves and stems retain their shape. Bees use the same kind of repetitive pattern to create strong honeycombs where they live and store honey. Bryan designs similar grids and uses maps to create a repetitive cell pattern. He starts with a single cell made by balancing four cards against each other to form a box. Then he repeats the cell over and over again and extends it outwards to form the grid, which forms a good basis for a strong map structure. The larger the grid, the more weight it can carry. Sometimes Bryan uses several maps, instead of just one, to construct the cell walls, making the grid even stronger. The trick, he tells children when he talks in the classroom, is to put your cards together as tightly as possible when you lay out your grid, and make sure the cards do not lean at all. After building this solid base, Bryan lays cards on top to make the floor for the next 'story' of the building. He can add towers, columns, towers or domes. Using the principle of cell repetition, Bryan builds structures of incredible strength. In the maps Not surprisingly, Bryan has always been interested in building things. When he grew up on a 'big, old farm' in the Iowa countryside, he had plenty of room to play. \" We were in the middle of nowhere, \"Bryan remembers,\" with plenty of room to do what we want. I always made something and used things like sticks or bales of hay. ' Bryan's grandfather taught him how to stack cards. Bryan's two interests - building and stacking cards - will soon be combined. But it was hard to stack in his family's farmhouse. \" \"Our old house had wooden floors that were not completely level,\" he reports. And they were not very firm. When people walked around, it was like 'earthquake action'. It was a challenge to build something that would not fall right away. ' Bryan built tower for tower; he went through many trials and errors before building anything higher than himself. When he places a few cards on top of his grid, he discovers how strong it is. Bryan's towers got taller. How long is it too long? Bryan's first Guinness World Record for the world's tallest map tower came in the spring of 1992 when he was in high school. When Bryan learned that the world record was 12 feet 10 centimeters, he built a slender tower that extended at 14 feet 6 centimeters. Done as a project for his geometry class, it took him 40 hours and 208 maps. Since then, he has won world records for even taller buildings. His youngest winner measured 25 centimeters and used about 2400 cards. _ Why don't these towers fall down? The key is in a good solid base, a recurring pattern of stories and a tapered top. Bryan likes to point out what map buildings look like real buildings. They are built cell by cell, story by story. The separate parts make a strong whole. The heavier the building, the stronger and more stable. But the weight may not be all over the top. After spending so much time building something so cool, Bryan admits that it's sometimes painful to see its structures destroyed. But he compares his work to building a sandcastle or an ice sculpture.",

Vitamin A prevents skin and other tissues from drying out. People who do not get enough vitamin A cannot see well in the dark. Vitamin A is found in fish liver oil and the yellow part of the eggs. Vitamin B-1 is also called thiamine. Thiamine converts starchy foods into energy. Thiamine is found not only in whole grains such as brown rice, but also in beans and peas, nuts and meat and fish. Vitamin B-12 is needed for folic acid to do its job. Together they help to produce red blood cells. Folic acid has been shown to prevent physical problems in infants when taken by their mothers during pregnancy. Vitamin B-12 is naturally found in foods such as eggs, meat, fish and dairy products. Vitamin B-12 is found in green leafy vegetables and other foods, such as legumes and citrus fruits. Vitamin C is needed for strong bones and teeth. The body stores little vitamin C. Therefore, we need to get it every day in foods like citrus fruits, tomatoes and uncooked cabbage. Vitamin D prevents the rickets of childhood diseases. Ultraviolet light from the sun converts a substance in the skin into vitamin D. Fish liver oil also contains vitamin D. Vitamin K is needed for healthy blood. It thickens the blood around a cut to stop bleeding. It is also found in pork products, liver and in vegetables such as cabbage, kale and spinach. Vitamins are important for our health.

Canadian teenager Justin Bieber (16) has just had the magical experience: he posted homemade videos of his versions of songs by American singer Chris Brown online for his family members. He got a call from Brown telling how much he liked his actions. His singing eventually earned him a fan base and a record deal. After releasing a popular album in November 2009, his album My World 2.0 was released last Tuesday. Bieber sings ballads and songs about dog love. But is he just another tough teenage god? David Malitz, a columnist for the Washington Post, does not think so. \" \"If we really want the best for American children, let's stop and thank Justin Bieber,\" he writes. After years of humdrum bubblegum from Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers, the 16-year-old threw a wrench into Disney's sad assembly line by giving young fans something worth shouting their lungs out for sweet pop songs. From a boy who grew up below the poverty line with his divorced mother to a star who caused melee in shopping malls, even Bieber could not believe his fame overnight, although his kind of success became increasingly common in the internet era. . The boy is interested in hockey, the national sport of Canada, and once posted pictures of players on the walls of his bedroom. He dreamed of being a hockey star and used to sign his autograph. He does not need exercise now. He draws autographs, if the girls can get close enough, as a music star.",

Chanel No.5 This perfume is probably the best selling fragrance in the history of fragrance. It was created by Ernst Beaux for Coco Chanel in 1921 and is described as 'the world's most legendary fragrance', and it is still the company's most famous perfume. Shalimar Jacques Guerlain created this vanilla flavor in 1925. The perfume gets its name from the garden of Shalimar, which was built by Emperor Shah Jehan for one of his wives. It was an instant hit in 1925 and is still extremely popular today. Joy Joy is known for being the most expensive perfume in the world at one point. It was created in 1930 by Henri Almeras for Jean Patou to lift the bad mood that swept around the world after the 1929 collapse. L'Air duTemps Francis Farbon created Nina Ricci's L'Air du Temps in 1948. The fragrance is known for its spicy carnation and gardenia flavors, as well as its beautiful crystal bottle (designed by Lalique). Eternity Calvin Klein's second perfume was created in 1988 by Sophia Grojsman. The perfume, known for its light, fragrant scent, was inducted into the Fragrance Hall of Fame in 2003. It is recommended for day wear. Angel This hugely popular perfume was created in 1992 by Olivier Cresp for Thierry Mugler. The perfume was an immediate success. The perfume is often described as 'delicious' because of its chocolate flavor. The perfume comes in beautiful star-shaped bottles. Angel perfume is also found in various bath and body products.",

Well, to understand that, you simply look at how you felt when you heard music in these places. It is known that music improves the mood of people. Often music helps us to pay attention to what we are doing. Music helps patients feel good and helps them recover faster and better. Depression is a state of mind that most of us experience at some point in time. There are some periods in our lives in which everything seems difficult. Everything seems to be getting worse and we have no control over our lives. Studies have shown that music can be an important mood in such situations. Music also plays a big role in making us feel less nervous or worried. Anxiety can often cause loss of sleep and other illnesses. Music is often known as an international language. We may not know the language another person speaks, but most of us respond to music in the same way. Music can often be the best way to connect with someone. Music is one of the best ways to improve your mood, but it can largely depend on the type of music you are listening to. While happy music can definitely make you feel better, sad music can make your mood drop further. Listening to classical music can make you feel much more powerful, while soft music can be the perfect way to relax at the end of a long road. If you want to use music to change the way you feel, you need to understand its role, learn to recognize the kind of music that raises your mood and makes you feel better. Once you realize what kind of music you can use, you can use it to change the way you feel. The right kind of music can be the perfect way to make us feel happier.",

          "context": "Smoking bans in public places are related to the decrease in asthma attacks in children and premature births, according to the largest analysis of the impact of public smoking bans on children's health. The finding should remove the fears that such laws could have the opposite effect, as it could make people smoke more at home. Several countries, such as Japan and Australia, have tightened laws on smoking in public places in recent years. Meanwhile, some countries, such as the Netherlands and Germany, still allow smoking in pubs and restaurants. Only half of the U.S. states have comprehensive bans, and there are few restrictions in poorer countries. Opponents often claim that bans can cause people to smoke more at home, which will be worse for the health of their children. Asthma is one of the major concerns as secondhand smoke harms children in different ways. Researchers led by Jasper Been at Maastricht University Medical Center examined as many as 11 studies investigating hospital admissions for asthma in children and preterm infants. The studies involved more than 2.5 million births, and nearly 250,000 hospital admissions for asthma. The result shows that the uptake of asthma and the birth rates dropped by about 10 percent within a year after smoking restrictions were implemented. The effect on premature births could also be caused by pregnant women who are more likely to stop or shrink after a public ban, Bone says. But Been also says the studies could not completely prove that smoking bans directly caused these changes. In fact, because the analysis included several smoking bans imposed in different countries in different years, and saw the most health improvements. Such findings are useful for countries and countries where there is an ongoing debate about how strict a smoking ban should be, especially since hospital care for premature babies is so expensive. This is perhaps one of the most important things to know to strengthen legislation. Other studies have shown that the rate of heart attack and stroke also tends to decrease after smoking is banned.",

The law, which will be passed this month, is likely to cause a revolution in family affairs in a country where 40% of men apparently do not do homework at all. It will oblige men to share 'household responsibilities and the care and attention' of children and elderly family members, according to the draft approved by the Spanish parliament's justice commission. \" This will be a great way to remind people what their duties are. This is something feminists have wanted for a long time, 'said Margarita Uria, of the Basque Nationalist Party, who was behind an amendment to a new divorce law. Failure to meet the obligations will be considered by judges when determining the conditions for divorces. Men who refuse to do their part may have less frequent contact with their children. Spanish women spend five times longer on homework than men. Even when both have jobs outside the home, Hispanic women still do three times as much work in the home. \" However, it is not just about homework, \"said Ms. Uria. In a study conducted by the Spanish Center for Sociological Research five years ago, it was concluded that fathers take care of their children for an average of 13 minutes every day. Only 19% of Spanish men thought it was right for mothers of children of school-going age to work full-time. More than a third thought that mothers should not work outside the home at all. The change in the Spanish legal code will add domestic obligations to a list of marital duties that currently include marriage, living together and helping each other. This should guarantee that when the law is passed in parliament in the next few weeks on the law - which will also make divorce proceedings faster and easier - in parliament, the obligation to share household chores will be added to the code.",

My train drove a little late, but it was no big deal. I could send an SMS saying I would be delayed. He would understand. But ... where was my cell phone? I had that familiar sinking feeling. Yes, I forgot it at home. No cell phone. I'm sure I'm not alone in feeling anxious, and worried when I do not have my phone with me. In fact, I know I'm not alone: two-thirds of us experience 'nomophobia', the fear of not having contact with the cell phone. This is according to a 2012 study that surveyed 1,000 people in the UK about their relationship with mobile phones. It states that we check our cell phones 34 times a day, that women are more 'nomophobic' than men and that 18-24 year olds probably suffer the most from being without their cell phones: 77% of them say they are no longer can be a few minutes away from their phones. Do you have nomophobia? * You never turn off your phone * You obsessively search for texts, missed calls and emails * You always take your phone with you to the bathroom * You never run out of battery. It's funny to think that about 20 years ago the only people with mobile devices were a businessman carrying their big, plastic 'bricks'. Of course, cell phones are everywhere these days. A UN study this year said mobile subscriptions would be more than people by the end of 2014. And if there are more phones than people in the world, maybe it's time to ask who really is the leader? Are you in control of your phone, or are you in control of your cell phone? So, what happened to my college friend? When I arrived a few minutes late, he just laughed and said, \"You have not changed at all - always late!\" And we had a wonderful afternoon, full of jokes and stories, with no interruptions and no nagging desire to check my phone. Not having it with me felt strangely liberating. Maybe I'll leave it at home next time on purpose.",

In his late teens, Armstrong began living the life of a musician. He played in parades, clubs and on the steamboats that traveled on the Mississippi River. At that time, New Orleans was known for its new jazz music and was home to many great musicians. Armstrong learned from the older musicians and was soon respected as their equal. In 1922 he went to Chicago. There begins the story of Louis Armstrong. From then until the end of his life, Armstrong was celebrated and loved wherever he went.

This is the challenge for users of a new virtual reality program called SurviVR, designed to train employees on how to handle an active shooter situation in the workplace. The app works with HTC Vive, the virtual reality headset released earlier this year. An active shooting situation is when an armed person or people are actively shooting in a small populated area with the aim of killing. According to FBI statistics, there were 20 such situations in the United States last year and 20 the previous year, resulting in a total of 231 deaths. This year was the deadliest situation in American history, with 49 people killed in a nightclub in Orlando. In the training situation, users have four choices. They can lock themselves in the office. They can hide, perhaps in the office cupboard. They can run for an exit. Or they can use something in the office - a computer or scissors, as a weapon to fight the shooter. This is an improvement on standard active shot training. Gallo says, what people usually learn is to lock themselves in and hide. The method of 'locking up' is often ineffective, he says, and has resulted in many deaths in recent years. At the basic level of training, no one is killed. But as training becomes more advanced, players who choose wrongly are shot. There is no blood; the screen simply slowly turns black. If that sounds scary, it's the point, Gallo says. There are many training programs to teach employees how to deal with violence in the workplace, which sometimes include role-playing with toy guns. But this training is basically games. Gallo says, with employees relaxed and even nice. To teach people what they really need to know for an active shooter situation, they need to be scared. \" SurviVR will take the fear and turn it into confidence. ' Gallo says.",

Apart from the taste, you simply can not resist it because it holds many benefits in terms of your health. Our health is our priority when it comes to choosing our food. If you are worried that chocolate is bad for your health, here is a list of the effects of dark chocolate on your health, especially if you take the right amount each day. In the first place, it contains a component called falconoid which acts as an antioxidant. The antioxidants combat the common signs of aging. The antioxidants are also good for the heart. Studies have shown that people who eat foods rich in antioxidants have a low risk of heart disease. In addition to the benefits against aging and healthy heart, the dark chocolate can also lower blood pressure and lower bad cholesterol to as high as 10%. Lowering blood pressure in patients with high blood levels is good because it will reduce the risks of stroke and certain health crises. Low levels of blood cholesterol are also good for the heart and take away the risk of blood vessels that can harden for too much cholesterol in them. Finally, do you know the feeling of overwhelmed joy after jogging? This feeling is like extreme happiness. Dark chocolate gives you the feeling of pleasure and happiness. If you feel that the world has turned against you, a chocolate can be a mood. It can help fight depression. When we feel so bad, we usually want to eat more food. If you are looking for something to eat during your bad moments, try to take a bite out of a dark chocolate and feel good somehow afterwards. These are usually the effects of chocolate on health. It can benefit you, especially if you take it in moderation. About 100 grams of chocolate or less per day is already enough according to studies. If you have ingested too much, try to reduce your other meals for the day. It's all about nutrition and consuming the right amount of food to achieve the health benefits it can offer you.",

How much do you know about the Scandinavian country? Denmark is known for its design culture. The core of \"Danish Design\" is the idea that, as the poet and designer Piet Hein puts it: \"There is one art, no more, and no less, [and that is] to do everything with artlessness. \" Danish design places equal emphasis on practicality and quality. From Lego toys to furniture, Danish products are known for their clean lines, simplicity and functionality. \" Remove material where it is not needed. Keep things simple and functional and make them careful, \"explains Hans J. Wegner, the first Danish designer to gain worldwide fame:\" The goal is not to create a work of art, but to produce a good chair. \" The Danes have done a better job than most in promoting arts in Europe, given the size and population of their country, in terms of architecture, sculpture and design, 'writes Helena Smith, reporter for the British newspaper The Guardian. The simplicity of the Danish design can also extend to the quality of life there. Some even claim that the Danes have the highest quality of life of any nation in the world. Kate Vial, a 55-year-old American who has lived and worked in Denmark for more than thirty years, and explains why she prefers to live in Denmark rather than the USA, told Der Spiegel, Germany's largest news weekly: lifestyle, one where I could ride anywhere on my bike and where I did not have to make a good living to survive.

I'm really tired, but my first day at school went well and I feel much better now. First, we had to meet outside the school building. I was very nervous because my primary school had only 300 pupils, but in high school there are about 1,300. What a difference! The older students are really great. I feel so small waiting there before school. The other problem was that I did not know anyone. My family moved over the summer holidays because of Dad's new job. So now I have to try to make new friends. While standing in front of the school this morning, I wanted to be with my old friends at my old school. The head teacher came out and told us to enter the school hall. Then he called out our names to tell us what class we were in. My class teacher becomes Mrs. Called Black. She took us to our classroom. It's on the 5th floor and ... guess what? ... We are not allowed to use the elevator. I could not believe it. As we walk up the stairs, I start talking to another boy no one knows. He said his family moved from Hong Kong during the summer. He looked really nice, so we sat out of breath together when we got to our classroom! He said his English was very weak, but I thought it was really good. We spent the whole morning with Mrs. Black looked at our grids. Everyone in the school has a different timetable - can you believe it? Half of the school learns Spanish as a second language and the other half learns French. I'm in the Spanish group, which sounds nice. I'm worried I'll forget my schedule and go to the wrong room! How will anyone help me if no one else has the same roster as me? Lunch was OK. After lunch we started with lessons. I had math, which was complicated and difficult, and then history, where we started learning about ancient Greece. It looks interesting. I have to do homework tonight to find out how the ancient Greek people lived. So far so good. I'm quite looking forward to tomorrow, even though I have science. I hate science! Jason",

Klose said Volvo Cars has entered a new era of rapid development, adding that its sales volume in 2010 was in China.

Two new Volvo sales centers opened in Beijing in one week in early October, about two months after Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co in eastern China acquired the Swedish brand in early August for $ 1.5 billion from US car giant Ford. Klose said he is confident he will see tremendous growth in the auto market in China over the next five years. \" Since the Chinese government has already increased the tax rate for cars with large displacement, we now have many cars under three liters, and I think we will stick to the strategy, as you can see, the XC60 introduced today is only two liters , \"he said.\" As the technology advances, we will probably even see 1.6-liter engines or 1.5-liter engines in the future, 'he added.

Popular wisdom states that parents' relationships can suffer if their little ones fly into the cage because they feel they have lost their purpose in life. However, a new study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, found that many couples actually feel happier when their children leave home because they enjoy spending time together. A total of 123 American mothers born in the 1930s were tracked down for 18 years and asked to rate their satisfaction levels shortly after they were married, when their children reached their teens and finally at age 61, when almost all were \"empty\". next \". Although not everyone has said that they are happier in general, most claim that their marriages have improved since their children left home. Researchers believe this is not just because the spouses spent more time together, but because they were able to enjoy each other's company more. One of the participants in the study, which is published in the journal Psychological Science, said: 'Once the children grow up ... the tension is removed ... the responsibility is removed, so things are a little more relaxed.' Psychologist Sara Gorchoff, who conducted the study, said: \"The take-home message for couples with young children is 'hang in'. \" Her co-author Oliver John added, \"Do not wait until your children leave home to plan quality time with your partner.\" However, Dr Dorothy Rowe, of the British Psychological Society, said the consequences of an \"empty nest\" would depend on the parents' relationship with their children. \"If you're just waiting for them to leave home so you can get on with your life, then of course you'll be happy to see them go,\" she said, \"but if you've built your life around your children you'll be terribly lonely. .

Crowded areas such as theme parks are particularly suitable for their distribution. The disease starts with fever and develops into symptoms like cough, runny nose, red eyes, and so on.

Inside, she sees a few pounds of notes exactly like the ones her husband gave her. So she quickly looks in her own pocket - the notes are gone! Mrs. White was sure the woman next to her had stolen them. She immediately thought of calling the police. But because she did not want to make a fuss, she decided to take the money back from the old bag's old pocket and say nothing about it. She looks around to make sure no one is watching. Then she carefully puts her hand in the woman's pocket, takes the notes and puts them in her own handbag. When she got home that evening, Mrs. White showed her husband the beautiful hat she had bought. \" How did you pay for it?

This is the hybrid car. What is a hybrid car? Any car that uses two or more power sources is a hybrid car. Most hybrid cars at the moment are petrol electric hybrids. The petrol-electric hybrid car is just how it sounds - a cross between a petrol-powered car and an electric car. A gas-powered car has a fuel tank that supplies gasoline to the engine. An electric car, on the other hand, has a set of batteries that supply electricity to the car. To be useful to you or me, a car must be able to run at least 483 km (500 miles) before refueling, refueling quickly and easily and fast enough to keep up with other traffic on the road. A petrol car meets these requirements, but produces a lot of pollution. However, an electric car produces almost no pollution, but can only drive 80 to 161 km between recharges. And the problem was that the electric car was recharging very slowly and inconveniently. A gasoline-electric motor combines the benefits of two power sources into one system that uses both gas power and electric power. Some experts believe that the hybrid car is 'the next generation of smart cars'. A hybrid car can rise up to 50% further than a traditional car can use on the same amount of fuel! It saves driver money on gas and reduces air pollution!",

Many of these animals are not only skilled climbers, but also interesting ways to get from tree to tree. How do animals adapt and how do animals move? is comprehensive explorations of animal adaptations and movement for young readers. Both are part of a series of 21 books, The Science of Living Things. In How do animals adapt? Readers learn how animals adapt to survive, not only in terms of climate, darkness, food and defense, but also in offspring and humans. These adaptations are well laid out in duplicate pages, with examples clearly depicted in photographs and diagrams and developed by their captions. As the title suggests, movement is the focus of How do animals start moving? Beginning with a description of the explanation of motion, the reader is exposed to the different ways in which animals move in the air, on land, under the ground, and in the water. Several unconventional variations (e.g. loop of thumbworms, the rectilinear movement of snakes) are included. Once again, the photos and diagrams clearly support the discussions about animal movement with double pages. The language of both titles is simple enough for young readers without speaking down on it. In both books terminology is mentioned. Some of these words are set out in the basic glossary, while the majority are clearly set out in the text. Many of these terms offer readers some fascinating, unusual words (e.g., brachialization, potassium, shine, and estimation). Like much of Kalman's book, both of these titles have a table of contents, glossary, and index that are sufficient to introduce young readers to the nature of these instruments. Both titles will make excellent additions to any science collection for young readers.",

I had the feeling that something important had been said to me, but it took many years before it sank. At the time, going to university was a rare privilege. My dad told me if I chose something I wanted to study, I would always look forward to my job. But he also added: even a job you hate is better than not having a job at all. I wanted to become a farmer, but I joined a military program to pay for my university. And what started as an obligation to the army has become a way of life that I have dedicated to for 37 years.

He told me a machine would put the lady out of work. And as bad as that woman's job was, it was enough to keep a small family alive. It reminded me of my father's words: to work is a blessing. After seeing many people like that woman in Bangladesh, I believed that people without jobs are not free. They are victims of crime, ill health and depression.

Many studies examining the lives of centenarians look at what they eat. Many people living in the hundreds live in the Mediterranean, so their diet, which contains lots of fruits, vegetables, nuts and healthy fats like olive oil, gets a lot of attention. The diet is linked to a healthier older age, a lower risk of heart disease and even protection against memory loss. Education is related to a longer life. A 2012 report by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics found that people with a bachelor's degree or higher live about nine years longer than people not in high school. James Smith, a health economist at the RAND Corporation, is also a proponent of the argument that he stays in school for a better life expectancy. His findings show that education should be an even bigger factor than race and income. Educated people are more likely to get better jobs, plan their future and make healthier lifestyle choices. Being a hard worker does not necessarily mean that work stress will harm you. The Longevity Study found that many hard workers lived a long life. \" Skeptics may wonder if hard workers really enjoy life. ' the authors write, \"We have found that productive, hard-working people (even in old age) are not stressed or miserable, but tend to be happier, healthier, and socially connected than their less productive counterparts.\" Having a strong social group is associated with a longer life. We often turn to friends and family for support, and taking care of the people who are important to us can help us take better care of ourselves, evidence shows. Some research even suggests that immune function is enhanced when we are with friends, and that it helps with stress management. Research shows that sitting people for a shorter lifespan and other health risks to sitting longer. A 2011 study found that every hour people sit after 25 years of age and watch TV is linked to 22 minutes of their overall life expectancy.",

Sharapova did not get an easy ride in the tournament as she had to beat the 1999 champion, Lindsay Davenport, in the semi-finals and Serena Williams, two-time champion, for the title. None of them worried her much. \" I do not remember too much of the final, \"Sharapova giggled. I was in my own place. ' From now on, she will find it increasingly difficult to find a place to name her own after advertisers identified her as the most marketable woman in sports. In Russia, it is sensational news. She was head of the news bulletins and was called after her triumph by former Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Sharapova will return to her agreeable home in Florida and know that life will never be the same again. But the girl, who arrived in the United States at the age of seven with her father and only $ 700, is determined to let fame and fortune detract from her greatest love, tennis. \" I know things will start to happen and that many more things want to get involved, but I want to keep my head cool and play tennis, 'she said.",

If you are afraid that you are not disciplining your children enough, the evidence of parental failure is there in front of everyone. The child does not complete her university applications! If you are afraid that you have allowed your children to watch too much television and be content with low grades, you will have to answer the consequences. The over-involvement of many parents in the process is, from my perspective, a cover for the deep anxiety of parents: Did I do a good job with this child? Did I do everything I needed to do for this child? Is this child going to have a good life? I have already seen parents of parents dive back into their children during the admission period and try to instill all their wisdom and discipline in their children at the last minute. Parents may need to be sure when their children leave the nest that they are really learning how to fly. Since at this stage it is impossible to determine the quality of what parents have done for their children, the status of the colleague to whom the child is admitted is the best. From an anxious parent's point of view, a child with 'Ivy l, eague college' is proof of better child rearing than a 'small college' child. I once sat with a talented, weak older girl and her brilliant parents. She, they and the school had to decide whether to enter the school or go to a hospital. In light of her anorexia (), the school strongly recommended that she not submit her earlier application to Princeton. When she heard this, she looked at the adults in the room and said, \"If I can not apply to Princeton early, I will die.\" Her parents were also eager to land her in Princeton. Why did they all need it so urgently? Because in this case, there was something wrong in the family. Due to the weakness in her upbringing, this child was not happy or confident. Yet she was eighteen, according to the culture she had to leave the house. The psychological solution for everyone was the comforting vision of a wonderful university. In a way to get there, her life will be good and defend the upbringing of her parents. Such fears about the release of an unfinished child exist in all families. How can we release a child who is still so young in so many ways? It is painful and has no cure other than time and hope. For parents who want a painkiller, the admission process can work out the college their concerns.",

Yes, I take less. There is no doubt about it. ' Restaurants were less enterprising than usual at this time of year. And a tourism association says a survey among its members found that the Games had a negative impact across the UK, but British officials still maintain during the recent recession that the Games were worthwhile. Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, said: 'I think it was a wonderful version of what you can do if you plan and work on a project for years and years. And I think that's an excellent advertisement for British engineering and British industry.

My wife and I wanted to give James the best training, but that means we have to change jobs and spend less time with our child. I asked myself, \"Will this compromise be worth it?\" When I look at research on child development, I think that may not be the case. Where our children go to school may matter less than most American parents think. Social scientists have long tried to determine why some children grow up to be successful. In a 2001 study, Greg Duncan, a professor of education at the University of California, measured the influence of people in a child's life on how well the child is doing in school. Duncan and his team found almost no connection between how students performed on the test and with whom they sat in class, with whom they visited school, and in their block. The only significant link they found was especially between siblings and twins. Scholars have long thought that a family's income had a major impact on how well children fared in life. But that may not be the case. When Susan Mayer at the University of Chicago looked at the relationship between family income and lifelong achievement, she conducted a series of experiments to measure it and found that such outcomes were not caused by income. She argued that the things that make a difference are relatively inexpensive: the number of books a child has or how often his family goes to museums. Lareau, another scholar, began with one of the deepest observations of American parenting. He concluded that success is much more related to the amount of time parents spend with their children. He said “Many parents I interviewed are anxious about the future of their children. But they have exaggerated the risks involved in not giving their children 'the best' of everything. ' Eventually we decided to leave things as they are. More time with our child is the best we can offer.",

At the beginning of the year, the pupils each received a _, ranging from 'excellent prospect' to 'probably not good'. These were totally untrue ratings and do not reflect how well the pupils have performed before. However, these ratings were given to the teachers. At the end of the year, the experiments compared the students' performance with the grades. Despite their real abilities, there was a surprisingly high correlation between performance and ratings. People seem to be performing just as well as we expect. The self-fulfilling effect is also known as the Pygmalion effect. It comes from an ancient Greek story. The story was also the basis of George Bernard Shaw's play \"Pygmalion\", which later turned into the musical \"My Fair Lady\". In Shaw's play, Professor Henry Higgins claims that he can turn from a Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, into a Duchess. But, as Eliza herself pointed out to Higgins' friend Pickering, it does not determine whether she will become a duchess, but how she will be treated. The implication of the Pygmalion effect for leaders and managers is great. This means that the performance of your team depends less on them than on you. The performance you get from people is not more or less than you expect, which means you should always expect the best. As Goethe said: 'Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is. Treat a man as he can and should be and he will become as he can and should be. '",

Isn't it worth it to hold back, play it cool, and wait until the other half has shown their hand faster? \" A real good relationship should be about being honest and being equal, \"says psychologist Sidney Crown. But love is seldom equal. '' All relationships go through power struggles, but, \"he says,\" if a love imbalance continues for years, the rot will ensue. \" That feeling of 'I've always loved you' may have been undermined for a while (,), but it never completely disappears and it often comes to the fore in a rush. At least the quiet, restraining type in love is not always the most powerful. \" The strongest in a relationship is often the person who feels confident to talk about their feelings, \"says educational psychologist Ingrid Collins. Psychosexual therapist Paula Hall agrees. \" The one with the upper hand is often the person who takes the initiative. ' In fact, the person who first says 'I love you' may also be the person who says 'I'm bored with you first'. Hall believes that a lot depends on how 'I love you' and the motivation of the person saying it. Is it said when they are drunk? Is it said before their partner flies on vacation, and what it really means is, \"Please do not be unfaithful to me\"? By saying \"I love you\", they are really saying \"Do you love me?\" If so, it would not just be more honest to say so. Collins agrees that intention is everything. \" It is not what is said, but how it is said. What it comes down to is the sincerity of the speaker. '",

If you miss this opportunity, it is almost impossible for you to do so later in your life. * To gain a cross-cultural experience, life abroad can see your daily world in a new light. You do not even realize it, but our culture shapes the way we view the world and influences us every minute of the day. Differences in culture are more than just differences in language, food, clothing and art. * Improving your communication skills and confidence People studying abroad tend to be willing to take risks, willing to put themselves in unusual situations and solve problems. * Becoming a language proficient or learning a new language The world market is shrinking, and many businesses need a second language. Foreign languages are not only valuable in the labor market but also valuable in the real world. * For the adventure Travel to other cities in your host country and surrounding neighbors. As you get to know your new classmates, roommates and host family, you get a unique look at the host culture. Discover the differences and, more importantly, the many similarities between your worlds. The friendships you make will last long after the program. * Finding out more about yourself Find out who you really are. What are your limits? How can you overcome the problems you have never had before? How independent are you? These questions are difficult to answer until you are removed from your normal environment. After solving difficult problems abroad, you will find that almost nothing can confuse you at home. Students studying abroad usually report that their study abroad has changed their lives.",

The London 2012 Organizing Committee (Locog) confirmed on Wednesday that a mistake in selling tickets had led to four synchronized swimming competitions with 10,000 tickets being oversold. Locog and his ticket agent made contact with ticket holders over the Christmas period and offered alternatives that included the tickets they applied for but were unsuccessful. The hangers do not require any extra cost. It also offered to return any inconsistency if the new tickets cost less than the original tickets. Locog said the replacement tickets would come from a number of unsold seats at the Olympics and _ did everything in its power to compensate the mistake to the fans who bought tickets. Locog said the mistake occurred in the summer between the first and second rounds of ticket sales, when a staff member made a mistake by entering '20,000 'on the computer, rather than the correct figure of 10,000 remaining tickets. The error was discovered when Locog checked the number of tickets sold against the final seat numbers and started contacting ticket holders before Christmas. Thousands of ticket holders have happily beaten and changed to tickets for major events, including swimming and athletics finals, and in about 200 cases the most popular of all, the men’s 100m final. Locog said the decision to award 100 million final tickets was made because one of the synchronized swimming competitions took place on the same afternoon as the August 5 event.",

Tests on rats show that those who raise two or more litters of pups perform significantly better in memory and skills tests than rats that have no babies, and their brains show changes that indicate they can be protected against diseases such as Alzheimer's. psychology professor Craig Kinsley believes his findings will translate into people. \"Our research shows that the hormones of pregnancy protect the brain, including estrogen, which we believe has many neuroprotective effects,\" Kinsley said. \" This is data from rats, but humans are mammals just as these animals are mammals, 'he added in a telephone interview. \"They go through pregnancy and hormonal changes.\" Kinsley said he hopes public health officials and researchers will look into whether they have had children who protect a woman from Alzheimer's and other forms of age-related brain loss. \" When people think of pregnancy, they think of what happens to babies and the mother from the neck down, \"said Kinsley, who presented his findings at the annual meeting of the Society of Neuroscience in Orlando, Florida. They do not realize that hormones are flushing on the brain. If you look at female animals that have never been pregnant, they behave differently towards young people. But if she gets pregnant, she will sacrifice her life for her baby - this is a major change in her behavior that has been shown by genetic changes to the brain. '",

          "context": "Five or six years ago, I attended a lecture on the science of attention. A professor doing research in medical school talked about attention blindness, the basic characteristic of the human brain that we, when we concentrate on one task, miss virtually everything. Because we cannot see what we cannot see, our lecturer was determined to catch us. He showed us a video of six people throwing basketballs back and forth, three in white shirts and three in black, and our job was to just keep up with the throwing at the people in white. The band rolled, and everyone started counting. Everyone except me. I am dyslexic and the moment I saw the band with the confusing basketball pitchers, I knew I would not be able to keep up with their movements, and I let my mind wander. However, I became curious when a gorilla stepped in between the players for about 30 seconds. She (we later learn that a female student was in the gorilla suit) stares at the camera, hits her chest with her fist and then walks away as they pass the balls. When the band stopped, the professor asked how many people counted at least a dozen basketball boxes. Hands went up everywhere. He then asked who counted 13, 14, and congratulated those who scored the perfect 15. Then he asked, \"And who saw the gorilla?\" I raised my hand and was surprised to discover that I was the only person at my table and one of only three or four in the great room who did. He set us up and caught us in our own attention blindness. Yes, there was a trick, but it was not he who played it on us. By concentrating so hard on counting, we managed to miss the gorilla in the middle. Attention blindness is the fundamental organizing principle of the brain, and I believe it offers us a great opportunity. My opinion is different from that of many neuroscientists: where they see the shortcomings of the individual, I feel an opportunity for collaboration. Fortunately, given the interactive nature of most of our lives in the digital age, we have the tools to control and utilize our various forms of attention. It is not easy to admit that everything we have learned about how to pay attention means that we miss everything. It is not easy for our logical, intelligent and confident types to admit that the key to our success - our ability to discover a problem and solve it, an achievement that has been achieved in all the years at school and beyond is - exactly can be us. No one ever told us that our way of seeing left out all the others.",

Three days later, when he returned from work, Jack discovered a small package in his mailbox.

With lower quality lenses and image sensors, smartphones are unlikely to replace professional video cameras any time soon. Some creative filmmakers are still pushing the boundaries of smartphone manufacturing by recording professional-quality movies using only smartphones. Shortly after Apple's iPhone 4 was released, two filmmakers decided to make a short film with only their iPhone 4s. Michael Koerbel and Anna Elizabeth James shot and edited the movie Apple of My Eye in just 48 hours. The audience was fascinated by the film, in which a man and his grandfather emotionally connect while admiring a model train in a shop window. The filmmakers followed up their success with Goldilocks, an extraordinary espionage novel told over nine, three-minute films. Many filmmakers are convinced that smartphone movies are here to stay. One sign is that they are being included at the big film festivals. In February 2012, organizers of the Berkshire International Film Festival hosted the 10 X 10 On North Festival. Entries included Oliver from Hooman Khalili, an award-winning film about a girl whose special powers enable her to spice up the lives of three lonely people. Another entry was Yearlapse'11, a 365-second film by Zsolt Haraszti that describes a real journey he made from New York to London. During the festival, which took place from February 16 to 26, these and many other smartphone films were shown at the Beacon Cinema in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Similar festivals in Canada and South Korea have given smartphone makers the opportunity to showcase their creative work.",

Severe weather and associated flooding affect all public transport, with bus, ferry and train services being affected to varying degrees. \" If you plan to use public transport at any time during the next few days, I would recommend that you check to see if your service is still available. ' Service interruptions for today include: l City network trains running hourly on all lines. l Diversions, delays and cancellations by bus in some regions, especially in Brisbane, Ipswich and the Sunshine Coast. l CityCat and CityFerry services have been canceled. Queensland Rail CEO Paul Scurrah said the rising waterways had closed some train lines and that the closure of the road and damage to property across the South East had contributed to a shortage of available railway workers. \" We plan to run trains per hour on all lines, similar to the timetable we operate on Christmas Day. We will also strive to operate other additional services to meet the demand as needed. At this stage we will hold services that stop at all stations departing at the same time, but this is all subject to the weather conditions and the availability of staff. \" Mr Scurrah encouraged all customers to visit the Translink website for specific departure times for their station, and asked for patience in case of delays. \" Queensland Rail realizes that reduced services can cause disruptions, but it is simply inevitable. We have a dedicated and experienced team that monitors the situation 24 hours a day and will work to reopen the network as soon as possible, \"said Scurrah.

An argument is made that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device, the BRICs, really should be the BICs. \" Is Russia really worth the name BRICs? ' asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article on foreign policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of The Russian Balance State, believes that Putin and Medvedev's Russia are simply not worthy of joining Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic powerhouses. . He writes: 'The country's economic performance has dropped to such a low level that one has to ask whether it has any say in the world economy, compared to the other members of its group. I have just returned from Moscow, which is always dull during this season. Over the past seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state lives on oil and gas. ' Economically, Aslund has the figures on his side. The International Monetary Fund estimates that the Russian economy will decline by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow by 8.5 percent and India by 5.4 percent. There is less of a case for Brazil, with a drop of 0.7 percent, but it is still faring much better than Russia. But the BRICs are not just about economics. As mentioned above, it is a marketing tool to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment point of view, it can be argued that Russia leads the BRICs. The stock market has risen 128 percent this year, up from about 80 percent for the other three. Despite Russia's economic underperformance, the better performance on the equities at least indicates that it is indeed one of the group.",

But experts now warn that the current shoe fashion will cause teenagers discomfort in the short term and store years of foot, knee and back pain in the future. Here, the experts identify the problems caused by teens' shoe choices. KEDS / VANS Slip-on shoes with elastic sides are especially popular among teenage boys - with Keds and Vans the most popular brands. The biggest problem is that they are just too flat - so flat that the heel, which first falls to the ground, also becomes damaged and painful. BALLET PUMPS The worst shoes of all are such light and thin dolly shoes. The problem is partly their flatness, as with Keds and Vans. However, ballet pumps, which have no rope or heel, have other specific problems. \" Since the shoe has no fastening device, it depends on the toes to hold the shoe, which causes an awkward gait. This leads to short- and long-term problems such as calluses, heel and knee pain. \" WEDGES AND STILETTOS These shoes can also cause gait problems. They may look good, but the heels on this are so high that they can force the wearer's body weight forward, making it very unstable. Teens who wear these shoes regularly are also at risk of joining millions of women with constant back pain. SCHOOL SHOES So what do podiatrists have on their wish list, especially for everyday wear? Something in a natural, breathable fabric, with a rope to hold it, with a small heel and a deep toe box that does not press the toes, like Clark's, Marks & Spencer or Rhino. If your teen insists on wearing 'bad' shoes, you need to get some simple orthotics in the shoes. It supports and corrects the movement of the foot and can, if properly applied by a podiatrist, often change their gait and stop the damage.",

The internet is one of the approaches. Learning via the internet is a new style that seems to be more successful than traditional teaching. The internet offers schools a large amount of learning materials that are accessible to students online. Due to the choice of courses online, completing a program becomes much easier. We often went to the library when we needed information and spent hours searching for the right resources. Today there is a \"library\" in our house that is available 24 hours a day. From my personal experience, since I was a mother for the first time, I find the use of information very useful. While I am at home with my baby, I can still search for the materials I need and exchange thoughts and information with my classmates without leaving my home. The internet is not only a great provider of information but also saves money and time. People predict that education will be much cheaper in the future due to internet access to information. The cost of land, construction and wages for teachers is constantly increasing. In addition, regular courses (offline) depend heavily on books and other materials on paper, while online tutoring places electronic lectures and assignments, saving thousands of dollars each year. With no physical restrictions, the internet classes and courses are also very convenient. In classroom education, there is a limit to the number of students, while internet education is available to everyone. Students do not have to struggle to register for classes they like.

I'm writing for a big newspaper and I want to write a story about skydiving. To make it a realistic as well as exciting story, I decided that I had to jump in first. Unfortunately, I'm not good at any sport, let alone parachuting. My friend mr. Smith was willing to give me a hand. He took me to an elementary school. The first day's training included a few hours of instruction, but not my first fall out of a plane. For this I had to wait until the next morning. The next morning, after a hurried, anxious breakfast, I was taken to the airport. There were two heavy parachutes put on my back. Then I was asked to drive to a small plane that had just stopped slowly on the runway. Upon arrival on the plane, it climbs quickly. I started to feel nervous. When we reached a thousand meters, Harry, my teacher, hooked a line from my parachute to a steel ring in the plane. The rope was to pull my parachute open after I jumped. \" Get ready, Henry, '' said Harry. I moved carefully to the door. I wanted to cry, \"No, no, no!\" but no word comes. \" Jump! ' Harry called out loud. \" Jump! ' To my surprise, I kicked like a frog. Away from the plane, and down, down I fall. It worked! The air seems to be holding me up. I was very happy. Then I felt fast. My big parachute opened! It was like the best surprise I have ever had. I look down. There were rivers, trees, fields and houses. I hear the soft sound of the air. It was nice!",

There are states where the white man enforces his rule by force; there are states where the black man protests by setting cities on fire and by looting and looting. Important people on both sides, who in other respects appear to be reasonable men, stand up and quietly plead in favor of violence - as if it were a legitimate solution like any other. What's really scary, and what really fills your despair, is the realization that we have not made any real progress at all when it comes to the crunch. We may wear collars and ties instead of war paint, but our instincts remain basically unchanged. The whole recorded history of mankind, the tedious documentation of violence, has taught us absolutely nothing. We still have not learned that violence never solves a problem, but that it becomes more serious. The pure horror, the bloodshed, the suffering means nothing. No morning solution comes to light the next morning as we reflect on the smoke ruins and wonder what struck us. The real reasonable men who know where the solutions lie find it increasingly difficult to be tried. They are despised, distrusted and even persecuted by their own kind because they advocate such seemingly outrageous things as law enforcement. If half the energy used by violent acts is well spent, if our efforts were aimed at cleaning up the poor houses, improving living standards and providing education and employment for all, we would have come a long way to a solution. Our power is weakened by the fact that the rubbish left behind by violence must dry up. In a focused effort, it would not be impossible to fulfill the ideals of a stable social program. The benefits that can be gained through constructive solutions are evident all around the world around us. Real and lasting solutions are always possible, provided we work within the framework of the law. Before we can begin to think about peaceful coexistence between the races, we need to appreciate each other's problems. And to do that, we need to learn about it: it's a simple exercise in communication, in exchanging information. \" Speak, speak, speak, \"say the proponents of violence,\" all you ever do is speak, and we are no one the wiser. \" It's rather like the story of the famous lawyer who carefully explained his case to the judge. After listening to a long argument, the judge complained that he was not already wiser. \" Possibly, my lord, \"replied the lawyer,\" no one is wiser, but certainly much better informed. \" Knowledge is the necessary prerequisite for wisdom: the knowledge that violence creates the evils it pretends to solve.",

Therefore, doctors, dentists and nurses usually wear white uniforms. Babies are dressed in white during baptism and brides wear white wedding dresses during weddings. White in these cases is the symbol of innocence or purity. Sometimes white is used in expressions that are not good. \" Whitewash \"is such an expression. Initially, \"whitening\" meant repainting something with white paint to make it look better. Today, however, it means something else: to hide or disguise mistakes or failures. A \"white elephant\" is another example of white being used in a negative way. In ancient Thailand, a white elephant was considered a sacred animal, but it was very expensive to keep. The kings of those days offered a white elephant to the people they wanted to destroy. After receiving this sacred, royal animal as a gift, they may not sell or kill it. Today, a 'white elephant' means something big, useless and undesirable. In America, when people want to get rid of their furniture or clothes, they often have a \"white elephant sale\".",

Sure enough, the Chevy Nova never got anywhere in Latin America. Translation problems Sometimes it's the slogan that does not work. No company knows this better than Pepsi-Cola, with its \"Come Live With Pepsi!\" campaign. The campaign was so successful in the United States that Pepsi literally translated its slogan for its international campaign. It turns out that the translations were not quite right. Pepsi begged Germans to \"get out of the grave\" and the Chinese said, \"Pepsi is bringing your ancestors back from the grave.\" The picture is worth a thousand words. Other times involve the packaging. A photo of a smiling baby helps sell numerous pots of Gerber baby food. When Gerber started selling baby food in Africa, they used the same packaging as in the US, with the smiling baby on the label. Later they learned that in African countries the picture on the pot shows what the pot has in it, because many people there cannot read. Turning to Fate Even culture, religious factors, and pure coincidence can be involved. Thorn McAn shoes have a \"signature\" of Thorn McAn. To people in Bangladesh, which is a Muslim country, this signature resembled Arabic script for the word Allah.

It also determines whether the camera can electronically position the details it captures large enough to see, which is what makes images not clear enough to see when viewed on a larger screen. Portability \"The important thing is that the camera is not too big or heavy, and that it has a good zoom range for wide-angle and telephoto shots,\" Atherton told CNN. A good option would be a slim and lightweight pocket camera with a high-quality built-in optical zoom. \" These are very popular for travel as they are lightweight, but they are built with a telephoto lens that can zoom up to 60 times, \"Atherton said. Zoom and shutter speed For action or crowd shots, a fast shutter speed is a key factor. \" When it comes to something that is active, wildlife or people in action on the street, the faces change in a small part of a second, \"said Arnold,\" a fast shutter speed is useful to take the several hundred of photos you might need to get. that one winning shot. \"",

And researchers have suggested that the origins of dogs can be traced to Europe, the Middle East, Siberia and southern China. Central Asia is the newest and best candidate, according to a large study of dogs from around the world. Laura M. Shannon and Adam R. Boyko of Cornell University, and an international group of other scientists, studied not only purebred dogs, but also street or village dogs. Dr. Shannon analyzed three different types of DNA, Dr. Boyko said, the first time this has been done for such a large and diverse group of dogs from 38 countries. And that led them to Central Asia as the place of origin of dogs in the same way that genetic studies have located the origin of modern humans in East Africa. The analysis, Dr. Boyko said, pointed to Central Asia as the place where \"all the dogs alive today\" come from. The data did not allow a precise dating of the origin, he said, but showed that it occurred at least 15,000 years ago. Greger Larson of the University of Oxford, who is leading a large international effort to analyze ancient DNA from fossilized bones, said he was impressed by the study. \" It's really cool to see not only the number of stray dogs, but also the geographic breadth and number of remote locations where the dogs were sampled, \"he said in an email. He also praised the sampling of different types of DNA and the analytical methods. Dr. Larson, who was not involved in the study, said he thought the Central Asian finding required further testing. He said he suspected the origins of modern dogs were \"extremely messy\" and that no amount of sampling from live populations will be definitive.

This proverb is said to have been used for the first time in the 16th century. But in the 1960s, the expression \"rolling stone\" became famous in the rock and roll world. It became the name of a song, a rock group, and a magazine. Experts say it all started with a song by the American singer and guitarist Muddy Waters. He was one of the best blues musicians in the country until his death in 1983. His music influenced singers like Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. In 1950, Muddy Waters recorded a song called \"Rolling Stone\". A British rock group is said to have taken its name from the Muddy Waters song. The Rolling Stones first performed in 1962. Members of the group called themselves \"the largest rock and roll band in the world.\" In 1965, Bob Dylan released his song \"Like a Rolling Stone\". It is one of his best known and most influential works. It's an angry song about a woman who was once rich and successful. But now she is alone, \"aimlessly home, like a complete stranger, like a rolling stone.\" In 1967, a young man named Jann Wenner opened a magazine and called it \"Rolling Stone.\" The magazine reported on rock music and the popular culture that created the music.

          "context": "Tobacco companies are fighting efforts in the United States and Australia to make their products less attractive. In Washington, a federal judge last week prevented the Food and Drug Administration from requiring new warning labels on cigarette packages. Judge Richard Leon ruled in a case brought by five tobacco companies. The judge temporarily halted a new federal rule that requires big new warnings beginning next September. These include color images1, such as a corpse or diseased lungs. And now there are simple text warnings. Congress called for color images1 showing the dangers of smoking, similar to what Canada does. But tobacco companies say the new requirements approved in June violate their constitutionally guaranteed rights to freedom of expression. Judge Leon said the FDA cannot enforce the new labels before a lawsuit against the government is decided. Some experts say the process could take years. The judge said he believed the cigarette manufacturers were very likely to win the case. He said the images must be designed to appeal to the emotions, rejecting the government's arguments that they must be purely factual. Did he accuse the government of trying to use the labels to promote an \"obvious anti-smoking agenda?\" The head of an anti-smoking group, Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called the decision \"wrong in science and wrong in law.\" About a fifth of American adults smoke. The World Health Organization says that tobacco kills nearly six million people worldwide each year. More than 600,000 of them are non-smokers who breathe second-hand smoke. In Australia, tobacco companies want to end what would be the world's most restrictive laws on cigarette advertising. Cigarettes can only be sold in plain olive green packages. Only the brand and health warnings may appear. The Senate passed the bill last week and sent it back to the lower house to pass minor amendments. The law will take effect in December of next year. Tobacco companies say the legislation violates the Australian constitution. They say it would unfairly reduce the value of their trade names and trademarks. Health Minister Nicola Roxon says the government is ready for a legal fight.",

In the schools of ancient Greece and Rome, the tests used to consist of saying poetry out loud and giving speeches. In the European universities of the Middle Ages, students working for advanced degrees had to discuss questions in their field of study with people who had made a special study of the subject. This custom exists today as part of the process of evaluating candidates for the doctorate degree. Generally, however, modern exams are written. The written test, in which all students are tested on the same questions, was probably not known until the 19th century. Perhaps it was born with the great increase in population and the development of modern industry. A room full of candidates for a state exam timed exactly by electric clocks and carefully watched by managers, looks like a group of workers in a car factory. Certainly, during exams, teachers and students are expected to act like machines. One type of test is sometimes called an \"objective\" test. Aims to deal with facts, not personal opinions. To make an objective test, the teacher writes a series of questions, each of which has a single correct answer. Along with each question, the teacher writes down the correct answer and also three statements that seem like answers to students who have not learned the material correctly.",

We have worked to teach our children that drugs are dangerous, illegal, and bad. Today, I want to talk to you about the historic opportunity we now have to protect our nation's children from an even more deadly threat: smoking. Smoking kills more people every day than AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, murders, suicides, drugs, and fires combined. Nearly 90 percent of those smokers lit their first cigarette before turning 18. Consider this: 3,000 children start smoking illegally every day, and 1,000 of them will die sooner because of it. This is a national tragedy that all Americans should be honored to help prevent. For more than five years, we have worked to prevent our children from smoking before they start, launching a national campaign to educate them about the dangers of smoking, to reduce their access to tobacco products, and to severely restrict tobacco companies from advertising. young people. If we do this, we will cut teen smoking by almost half over the next five years. That means that if we act now, we have the power to stop 3 million children from smoking and, as a result, save a million lives.",

If we do not reduce each individual's demand for water (both directly and through incorporated water), the water situation will become dire. It is obvious that we cannot increase the demand for water much more without damaging effects on the environment, society and the economy. It is very easy to blame someone else for the water situation - \"if 70% of the water is used for agriculture, then that is what we should aim for\" - but it is not that easy. We all depend on the food and resources that agriculture provides, and while there are definitely opportunities to increase water efficiency on the farm, the solution will require more than that. We all share the responsibility for the sustainable management of our water resources, which means using less water at home, in the workplace, at school, on vacation, on the farm, ... everyone, everywhere, at all times. Time to save water! This means re-evaluating our relationship with water and learning to use it more sparingly. At the most basic level, it requires a change in behavior and assigning a value to water that truly reflects its value. We can also unlock the economic benefits of being water efficient. There are many real world examples in the case studies on this site. We all have a responsibility to save water if we want future generations to enjoy a standard of living similar to what we do now. In fact, many of the impacts associated with water use are likely to have an effect on our own lives. www.savewater.com.au has been designed to help you meet the challenge of efficient water use.

          "context": "An annoying problem for humans, who like to show off all the distant planets and moons we've explored, is that we've never gotten a good look right under our noses. The interior of the earth is relatively close, but how can we get there? The deepest oil well enters just six miles into the crust (the center of the earth is about 4,000 miles deeper). Russian scientists dug the deepest hole in Siberia, but bottomed out about 7.5 miles below the surface. The Mohole project, a US plan in the 1950s, called for drilling a 25-mile hole to the boundary between the hard rocks of the crust and the soft mantle. Unfortunately, the project had the support of the government. It is becoming more and more difficult to drill deep into the earth as the rocks become softer and softer. Hard but easily broken at the surface, the rocks become plastic at depth, and the pressure caused by the weight of the overlapping crust, about 52,800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles, makes further drilling impossible. What little we know about the interior of the earth (such as the fact that there is a crust, a mantle, and a core) comes from indirect evidence, such as earthquake analysis. So maybe it's time for a whole new method of exploring the interior of the earth. Scientist David Stevenson says we should forget about drilling holes. Instead, we should open a rift. Stevenson suggests digging a crack about half a mile long, one yard wide, and half a mile deep (not with a shovel) but with an explosion on the scale of a nuclear bomb. It then poured a few hundred thousand tons of molten iron into the crack, along with a robot. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, would move downward at about 16 feet per second, taking the robot with it and opening the rift deeper and deeper. The iron mass would fall for about a week and 2,000 miles to the outer edge of the earth's core, the robot sending data to the surface. Stevenson compares his idea to space exploration. \" We are going to a place we have not been before, \"he says.\" In all likelihood, there will be surprises. \" This idea can probably be put in the drawer marked Not going to happen. The robot would have to survive temperatures that would melt almost anything. But Stevenson's idea may inspire a fresh look at an old problem. Great things can come out of what seem like impossible ideas.",

It has been proven that if we wear clothes of certain colors, our feelings can change. Suppose we feel sad, if we dress in black we can start to feel worse.

Going to a bar with friends is always enjoyable in slightly different ways. However, on the other hand, a table can also give us many positive experiences at times. I just moved from New York City to the Pennsylvania suburbs. It's been a big change of pace, with some positives and negatives. One of the best parts is that I spend more time outdoors. I really enjoy being outside, especially eating outside. I had a goal to eat out as often as possible this summer, so one of my first purchases for the new house was a garden table and chairs. Is my garden table a thing or an experience? It's clearly one thing and yet it allows for the outdoor dining experience. I love to eat outside, which is why my garden table is one of my favorite purchases. Therefore, I find that the dividing line between things and experiences is more nuanced than at first glance. However, to be happy, the most important thing is what kind of purchases you have made. Sometimes we can all have purchases that seem like a waste of money, like probably half the clothes in our closets, but how does this happen? There are many reasons why this happens. The most important is that we spend much of our time working to earn money to buy things. The problem is that we buy a lot of things that we don't really need. There is nothing worse than looking in your closet and realizing how many hours you spent working to buy things you never use. But how about a table that allows you to enjoy being outdoors in summer? That is worth every minute and every penny and from that you will also get more happiness.",

The problem is so serious that urgent action is needed, warns the study, led by British and Chinese researchers. The research surveyed 2,191 students between the ages of nine and 12 in nine schools in Zhejiang, a very prosperous coastal province in eastern China, both urban and rural. 81% of young people said they were \"very worried\" about exams, 63% feared being punished by their teacher, 44% had been physically harassed at least sometimes, and boys were more likely to be victims than girls , and 73% had been physically punished by their parents. Most of the children complained that they had a hard time coping with the amount of homework assigned. More than a third reported headaches or abdominal pain (psychosomatic symptoms of stress) at least once a week. The most stressed children reported an incidence of aches or pains four times a week. The research, led by Therese Hesketh, a professor at the Center for International Health and Development at University College London (UCL), pointed to the extreme competitiveness in China's education system, from the beginning of primary school. \" The competitive and punitive educational environment leads to high levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms, \"say the authors.\" Measures to reduce unnecessary stress on children in schools must be urgently introduced. \" The article appears in the Archives of Disease in Childhood, a peer-reviewed journal of the British Medical Association (BMA). The \"urban\" setting for the study was Hangzhou, the provincial capital of Zhejiang, while the \"rural\" setting was a poor county in Quzhou prefecture in the west of the province. The study highlights some of the complexities that it says explain the demands for academic excellence and intolerance of failure. One factor is the dramatic increase in the country's prosperity, which has created \"never-before-seen possibilities for upward mobility\" and, in turn, has fueled pressure on children to do well in school. Other reasons are China's one-child policy and Confucian traditions of respect for parents and elders, filial piety, obedience, and discipline. \" The aspirations of many parents, who had limited educational opportunities, are now invested in their only children, \"he says. Previous studies on school-related stress and its impact on health are few and generally come from Scandinavia. A 2008 assessment of children aged 10-13 in Sweden found that 21 percent of boys and 30 percent of girls experienced headaches, and 17 percent of boys and 28 percent of girls experienced headaches. girls experienced abdominal pain at least once a week.",

Robert Dane and his Solar Sailor recently received first prize at the Australian Design Awards. The Solar Sailor has been in use for six months. It uses four sources of energy for its power: solar, wind, battery power with stored solar energy, and a fuel generator in the store, all controlled by computers. The ferry can travel up to 7.5 knots on wind and solar power alone. They are solar wings and fiberglass solar panels that not only absorb sunlight and store it in batteries, but also act as candles. \" We orient our solar panels to the sun in two planes, which increases the amount of energy we get from the sun by 40 percent, \"says Dane.\" And we can also use that same structure to do other work, which is also the sail, so these wing sails push the ferry forward like a soft sail does. \" Computers control the sun and wind and angle the solar wings to receive the most sunlight. If there is not much wind or it is a cloudy day, the energy stored in the batteries runs the electric motor for up to five hours. \" If the batteries are too low, then the computer turns on the generator so the ship can always meet business hours, or go from point A to point B no matter what, \"explains Dan. Dane got his idea for the Solar Sailor from a book about insects. He was in awe of how insects use their wings to collect solar energy and warm themselves. \" When I read that, I realized that there was a good example in nature of what we were going to do, which was to use a solar wing to collect solar energy and also to navigate, ”he says.",

Carnival celebrations are believed to have their roots in the feast of the Saturnalia, which, adapted to Christianity, became a farewell to bad things in a season of religious discipline to mourn and prepare for Christ's death and return. to the life. The modern Brazilian carnival dates back to Rio de Janeiro in 1641. It originally copied the European form of the festival, and later incorporated elements of Native American and African cultures. At the end of the 19th century, the ropes were introduced in Rio de Janeiro. They were groups of parades that marched through the avenues of the city playing instruments and dancing. Today they are known as blocks, which consist of a group of people who dress in costumes or special t-shirts with themes or logos. The blocks are generally connected to particular neighborhoods; They include both a music group and many revelers. The block parades have become an expressive feature of the Rio Carnival. Today there are more than 100 and the groups increase every year. Blocks can be made up of small or large groups of revelers with a clear title. Before the show, they gather in a plaza and then parade through sections of the city, often near the beach. Carnival time in Rio is very interesting, but it is also the most expensive time to visit Rio. Hotel rooms and other accommodations can be up to four times more expensive than regular rates.

They were blue jeans and sports shirts. Some have long hair and some have short hair. Sometimes a boy has longer hair than a girl. Even the language is different. Students learn to say firefighter for firefighter, police officer for policeman, and postman for postman. A person does not need to be a man to fight a fire or deliver mail.

It is being argued that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device, the BRICs, should really be the BICs. \" Is it really worth calling Russia BRIC? \" asks Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreigh Policy. Aslund, who also co-authored \"The Russian Balance Sheet\" with Andrew Kuchins, believes Putin and Medvedev's Russia is simply not worthy of being included alongside Brazil, India and China on the list of future economic powers. He writes: \"The economic performance of the country has fallen to such a weak level that one must wonder if it has something to say about the global economy, compared to the other members of its group. I just got back from Moscow, which is always boring this season. Over the past seven years, Russia has taken very little action to improve its economy. Instead, the state has been living off oil and gas. \" Financially, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund estimates that the Russian economy will fall 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There are fewer arguments for Brazil, down 0.7 percent, but it is still doing much better than Russia. But the BRICs are not just about economics. As mentioned above, it is a marketing device to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment point of view, it could be argued that Russia leads the BRICs. Its stock market is up 128 percent this year, while about 80 percent is for the other three. At the very least, however, Russia's poor economic performance and outperformance of the stock market suggest that it is indeed one of the bunch.",

          "context": "Many parents go to great lengths to protect their children from advertising on television and the Internet. But how can you protect a child from a large fast food advertisement painted on their school locker? Or a toy ad on the side of your school bus? As school budgets shrink, a growing number of schools in the US are selling advertising space on lockers and buses and in gyms or cafeterias. It is an easy way for schools to earn money. And the ads can bring relief to exhausted parents by making cash donations to support schools. While parents can always turn off televisions or computers, they cannot keep advertising out of schools. This is not the first time the problem has arisen. For example, a teen news program has been criticized for including ads in its 12-minute classroom broadcasts. And parent groups successfully fought a plan by a company called Bus Radio to put music and advertisements on school buses. But now things are different. Last month, Los Angeles approved a plan to allow businesses to advertise in district schools. Officials say the plan could provide up to $ 18 million for schools. In St. Francis, Minnesota, schools recently agreed to cover 10-15% of their lockers with advertisements. Time tells. Edward Saxton, a teacher at the school, says: \"Until now, parents are accepting this as a way to bring in the necessary money. The money pays for programs like arts, sports, and music. Parents don't like programs being removed. Me neither. Also, schools are thinking about the effects on children all the time. \" However, Susan Linn, an education expert, says, \"Children have already seen enough commercials on television, in magazines, and the products they use every day. School is not a place for announcements at all. \" Readers, what about you? Would you rather help organize another school fundraiser or expose your child to locker and bus advertisements? Is it worth raising taxes to keep ads out of schools or increasing your own cash support for the school through donations?",

The Belgian-born sociologist, whose research interests also include fighting terrorism, international policing, crime control and internet technology, says he has seen Lady Gaga at concerts 30 times. \" We are going to see Lady Gaga as a social event, \"Professor Deflem told the USC student newspaper, the Daily Gamecock.\" So it is not the person and it is not the music.

I mean, that's a social phenomenon. \" You will analyze business and marketing strategies, the role of old and new media, fans and live concerts, gay culture, religious and political issues, sex and sexuality, and the cities of New York and Hollywood, He says. Professor Deflem said he initially planned to call up the Sociology of Fame or Sociology of Celebrity course, and use Lady Gaga as an example. Also a fan of Frank Zappa, Prince, Led Zeppelin, Alice Cooper, Status Quo and Ritchie Blackmore, Professor Deflem says his interest in Lady Gaga began when he first saw her perform on television on January 9, 2009. \" They don't have to be hardcore fans.

Stages replace cars on busy streets With a host of free outdoor shows, you'll snap your fingers on anything from Dixieland to blues, African beats to modern trip-hop and everything in between. Are you ready? Just head east to the Newfoundland Targa Rally, which runs from September 9-16 this year. The 2,200-kilometer race runs through the eastern and central parts of the province and is the largest race of its kind in North America. In these sections you race against the clock instead of other competitors. This is a great opportunity to test the limits of your car and your skills. Hello Spring! In 1945, thousands of tulip bulbs gifted from the Netherlands were planted on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Canada. These gifts were a thank you to the Canadian soldiers who helped liberate the Netherlands in WWII. Since then, the capital has become home to the Canadian Tulip Festival. From May 4 to 22, Ottawa and Gatineau (a city in southwestern Quebec) will be covered in beautiful flowers. In addition to three million tulips, visitors can also attend concerts, featuring some of Canada's brightest musical stars.",

But since it was also a busy day, she knew she wouldn't have that much time either. So, I picked up my bell and _ for 4 minutes. Look, 4 minutes, if that's all you have, is enough to give your body a great fat-burning workout. How did I get a spectacular workout in 4 minutes? I used a training workout discovered 10 years ago by a Japanese sports scientist named TABATA. It includes warm-up periods of 20 seconds, followed by rest periods of 10 seconds, and exercises followed by 4 minutes. How is it possible to burn fat with a 4 minute exercise? It all depends on the quality of the work you do. Not in quantity. This is how I did it yesterday. You should never forget your warm-up. A TABATA workout consists of 20 seconds of 2-arm bell swings, 10 seconds of rest, 20 seconds of push-ups, and 10 seconds of rest. You should do those 4 rounds. That's it. I finished in a total time of 8 minutes at the time and when I got to school my heart was still beating quite strong.

Today, the temple is the scene of a busy repair program. A team of 15 Indian experts is organizing a workforce of 400 Cambodians, mostly women, who are cleaning, repairing and rebuilding parts of this temple. As I walked through the courtyards, I noticed that Cambodian women spent hours carefully cleaning a small stone area. Boards are laid to protect the painted gemstones while repair work is carried out. There are very few machines and little heavy equipment. Workers transport building materials in buckets at the end of long poles. Piles of stones lie in a corner of the courtyard, waiting to be replaced. The stone cleaning work is supervised by three Indian chemists. It is a very slow task. They first brush the stones clean using buckets of a weak chemical. Then the spaces between the stones are filled. Finally, another material is painted on the stones that will protect them from water forever. Work starts every day at 7 a.m. meter. and continues into the afternoon six days a week, with a break at noon. The night is the best time to visit the temple, after the tour groups have left. As the sun sets lower, shadows spread across the courtyard. After sunset, the sky turns pink. The gray stone towers turn a golden color before turning pink. Nowhere else in the world can there be such a peaceful and beautiful place.",

A good book can absorb our attention so completely that for the moment we forget our surroundings and even our identity. Reading good books is one of the greatest pleasures in life. It increases our contentment when we are happy and decreases our problems when we are sad. Whatever our primary purpose in reading, our contact with good books should never fail to bring us enjoyment and satisfaction. With a good book in our hands, we must never be alone. Whether the characters that appear in it are taken from real life or are purely imaginary, they can become our companions and friends. In the pages of books we can walk with the wise and good of all lands and of all times. People we meet in books can delight us, either because they resemble human friends whom we cherish or because they introduce strangers whom we are happy to welcome as new acquaintances. Our human friends can sometimes bore us, but the friends we make in books never need to tire us with their company. Turning the page we can fire them without fear of hurting their feelings. While human friends abandon us, good books are always ready to bring us friendship, sympathy, and encouragement. Of all the gifts of reading books, the most valuable is experience. Few of us can travel far from home or have a wide range of experiences, but we can all lead varied lives through the pages of books. Whether we want to escape the seemingly boring realities of everyday life or want to visit some far away place, a book will help us when nothing else can. To travel with reservation we do not need a bank account to pay for our trip; no airship, ocean liner, or streamlined train to transport us; without a passport to enter the land of our heart's desire. Through books we can feel the thrill of adventure without danger. We can climb high mountains, face the dangers of an Antarctic winter, or cross the scorching sands of the desert, all without difficulty. In the books we can visit the Hollywood studios; we can mingle with the gay crowds on the boulevards of Paris; we can join the picturesque peasants of an alpine village or the friendly natives of an island in the South Sea. In fact, through the books _. The possibilities for our literary experiences are almost limitless. The beauties of nature, the enjoyment of music, the treasures of art, the triumphs of architecture, the wonders of engineering, are open to the amazement and enjoyment of those who read.",

Airlines have stopped or changed flights across the Atlantic Ocean, leaving hundreds of passengers stuck at airports. Grimsvotn is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Europe. What makes Grimsvotn different is that it sits under a huge ice glacier up to 12 meters thick. The hot volcano heats the ice on it, which then forms a layer of water between the glacier and the volcano, keeping it stable. As the water flows from under the glacier, the pressure increases. Lava from the volcano then rises to the surface. That is exactly what is happening today. Now airlines have to make changes to their flights to avoid going through the volcanic ash clouds. According to KLM, one of the largest airlines in Europe, planes cannot go under or above the cloud. Going through the cloud can cause the ashes to get stuck in the aircraft's engines and damage the aircraft. The eruption has also caused problems for animals in Iceland. The volcano left ash and glass-sharp rocks all over the field. Farmers keep their animals indoors to prevent them from eating ash-covered grass or sharp objects.",

But it's not just the 26 miles and 385 yards that could be a daunting prospect. \" I have to admit that I was completely frustrated by the blockade and that for 18-19 miles I stayed away from people and was delayed, \"complained one participant after the 2012 London Marathon.\" I had to pass a lot of people and ended up with bruised forearms on all elbows, ”said another. How do these overcrowding problems arise and could they be reduced? Some researchers believe that we can find the answers through a more familiar system in which traffic jams appear: the flow of road traffic. Martin Treiber of the Technical University of Dresden in Germany has previously developed models for traffic flow. One of the first attempts to model traffic flow was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham of the University of Manchester. They looked at traffic as a kind of liquid flowing through a pipe and observed how the flow changes as the fluid becomes denser. At first, the flow rate increases as the density increases, as more material simply passes through in the same period of time. But if the density becomes too high, there is a risk of clogging and the flow rate drops sharply. Treiber's marathon model uses this same principle that the flow rate first increases and then decreases as the density of runners increases, thanks to a sudden change from free flow to busy. It assumes that there is a range of different preferred speeds for different runners, which each one maintains throughout the race. With only these factors, Treiber can calculate the flow of the corridors, knowing the \"load capacity\" at each point of the route. This allows Treiber to discover how the lockout might depend on race conditions, for example for different starting procedures. Some marathons start by letting all the runners start at the same time (which means those behind have to wait until those in front move forward). Others assign runners to various groups based on their ability and allow them to start in a series of waves. Treiber has applied the model to the annual Rennsteig half marathon in central Germany, which attracts about 6,000 participants. The traditional route had to be changed in 2013, because the police were no longer willing to close a road to ensure that runners could cross safely. It could go over a 60-meter wooden bridge or through a tunnel. Treiber used his model to predict the probable blockage caused in the various options. The model predicted that a massive exit would risk corridor overload if the bridge were used. Only by moving the starting point further back from the bridge could the danger be avoided, and even then, if some of the numbers assumed in the model were only slightly inaccurate, there was still the risk of jamming on the bridge. On the other hand, no dangerous blockage to the tunnel route seemed likely. The race organizers consulted Treiber's team and ultimately chose this option.",

Researchers at Imperial College London who published their results online said the discovery could lead to a more effective cough treatment. \" While coughing is not necessarily harmful, it can have a major effect on quality of life, and this discovery could be a major step forward in treating this problem, \"said Professor Peter Barnes. Ten healthy volunteers received theobromine, codeine, or placebo, a pill that does not contain any drugs, during the experiment. Neither the volunteers nor the researchers knew who received which pill. The researchers then measured the levels of capsaicin, which is used in research to cause coughing and as a sign of how well the medications are stopping the cough. The team found that when the volunteers were given theobromine, the capsaicin needed to produce a cough was about a third higher than in the placebo group. When they were given codeine, they only needed slightly higher capsaicin levers to cause a cough compared to placebo. The researchers said theobromine worked by keeping nerve activity, which causes coughing, low. They also found that, unlike some standard cough treatments, theobromine did not cause side effects such as drowsiness.",

          "context": "A house of cards? Sounds amazing right? Not if the architect is Bryan Berg, 31. He has made a career out of building fantastic card houses, stadiums, capitals, castles and the tallest card tower in the world. As it does? Bryan's structures are amazing because they are made entirely of perfectly balanced independent playing cards. Never use glue, tape, or anything else to attach the cards. Nor does he fold the cards. He has discovered another way to make a strong house of cards, using a trick of nature. To strengthen plants, nature builds them with cells that have strong walls. The rows and rows of these cells form a grid that helps the leaves and stems maintain their shape. Bees use the same type of repeating pattern to create strong combs, where they live and store honey. Bryan designs similar grids, using cards to create a repeating pattern of cells. It begins with a single cell formed by balancing four cards against each other to form a box. It then repeats the cell over and over again, expanding outward to form the grid, which makes a good base for a strong card structure. The larger the rack, the more weight it can support. Sometimes Bryan uses multiple cards, rather than just one, to build the cell walls, making the grid even stronger. The trick, he tells children when speaking in classrooms, is to place the cards as close together as possible when laying out the grid, making sure that the cards are not skewed at all. After building this solid foundation, Bryan places cards on top to make the floor for the building's next \"story.\" You can add towers, columns, steeples, or domes. Using the principle of cell repetition, Bryan builds structures of astonishing strength. On the cards It's not surprising that Bryan has always been interested in building things. Growing up on a \"big old farm\" in rural Iowa, he had plenty of room to play. \" We were in the middle of nowhere, \"recalls Bryan,\" with plenty of room to do whatever we wanted. He was always doing something, using things like sticks or hay bales. \" Bryan's grandfather taught him to stack letters. Bryan's two interests, building and stacking cards, soon merged. But stacking on his family's farm was a challenge. \" Our old house had hardwood floors that weren't all level, \"he reports.\" And they weren't very firm. When people walked, it was like 'earthquake action'. It was a challenge to build something that didn't fall off right away. \" Bryan built tower after tower; He went through a lot of trial and error before building something taller than him. When he placed a few decks of cards on top of his grid, he discovered how strong he was. Bryan's Towers began to grow. How high is too high? Bryan's first Guinness World Record for the tallest tower of letters in the world came in the spring of 1992, when he was in high school. Upon learning that the world record was 12 feet 10 inches, Bryan built a slim tower that reached 14 feet 6 inches. Done as a project for his geometry class, it took him 40 hours and 208 decks of cards. Since then, it has won world records for even taller buildings. Its last winner was 25 feet 3.5 inches and used about 2,400 decks of cards. _ Why don't these towers fall? The key is a good solid foundation, a repeating story pattern, and a tapered top. Bryan likes to point out how card buildings look like real ones. They are built cell by cell, story by story. The separate parts form a strong whole. The heavier the building, the stronger and more stable it is. But the weight can't be all on top. After spending so much time building something so cool, Bryan admits that it is sometimes painful to see its structures destroyed. But he compares his work to building a sand castle or an ice sculpture.",

There is a lack of one-on-one teaching. I would like personalized feedback from an expert in my field of writing. Some of the lectures have been very helpful, but they try to use too many different writing styles. For example, if you want to be a poet, your lectures may focus too much on novels.

If we do not get enough vitamins that we need in our food, we run the risk of developing a number of diseases. What foods should be eaten to stay healthy? Let's look at some important vitamins. Vitamin A helps prevent skin and other tissues from drying out. People who do not get enough vitamin A cannot see well in the dark. Vitamin A is found in fish liver oil and in the yellow part of eggs. Vitamin B-1 is also called thiamine. Thiamine converts starchy foods into energy. Thiamine is found not only in whole grains like brown rice, but also in beans and peas, nuts, meat, and fish. Vitamin B-12 is needed for folic acid to do its job. Together, they help make red blood cells. Folic acid has been shown to prevent physical problems in babies when taken by their mothers during pregnancy. Vitamin B-12 is found naturally in foods like eggs, meat, fish, and dairy products. Vitamin B-12 is found in green leafy vegetables and other foods, such as legumes and citrus fruits. Vitamin C is necessary for strong bones and teeth. The body stores little vitamin C. That is why we must obtain it every day in foods such as citrus fruits, tomatoes, and raw cabbage. Vitamin D prevents rickets from bone disease in children. Ultraviolet light from the sun turns a substance in the skin into vitamin D. Fish liver oil also contains vitamin D. Vitamin K is necessary for healthy blood. It thickens the blood around a cut to stop bleeding. It can also be found in pork products, liver, and vegetables like cabbage, kale, and spinach.

Music often helps us pay attention to what we are doing. Music helps patients feel good and helps them recover faster and better. Depression is a state of mind that most of us experience at some point. There are some periods in our life when everything seems difficult. It seems that everything is getting worse and we have no control over our life. Studies have shown that music can improve mood in such situations. Music also plays an important role in making us feel less nervous or worried. Anxiety can often cause loss of sleep and other illnesses. Music is often known as an international language. We may not know the language someone else speaks, but most of us respond to music in the same way. Music can often be the best way to connect with someone. Music is one of the best ways to improve your mood, but this can largely depend on the type of music you listen to. While upbeat music can certainly make you feel better, sad music can make you even more depressed. Listening to classical music can often make you feel much more powerful, while soft music can be the perfect way to relax at the end of a long journey. If you want to use music to change the way you feel, you need to understand its role, learn to recognize the kind of music that lifts your mood and helps you feel better.

          "context": "Smoking bans in public places are linked to decreases in childhood asthma attacks and premature births, according to the largest analysis of the influence of public smoking bans on children's health. The finding should eliminate fears that such laws may have the opposite effect because they may lead people to smoke more at home. Several countries, such as Japan and Australia, have tightened laws on smoking in public places in recent years. Meanwhile, some countries, such as the Netherlands and Germany, still allow smoking in pubs and restaurants. Only about half of the states in the US have full bans, and there are few restrictions in the poorest nations. Opponents often claim that bans could make people smoke more at home, which would be worse for their children's health. Asthma is a major concern, as secondhand smoke damages children's airways in a number of ways. Researchers led by Jasper Been at Maastricht University Medical Center reviewed up to 11 studies that examined how hospital admissions for childhood asthma and preterm births changed after the smoking ban went into effect. The studies involved more than 2.5 million births and nearly 250,000 hospital admissions for asthma. The result shows that both asthma admissions and preterm birth rates dropped by about 10 percent within a year after the smoking restrictions were applied. The effect on preterm births could also have been caused by pregnant women who are more likely to quit or cut back after a public ban, Been says. But Been also says that the studies couldn't fully prove that smoking ban directly caused these changes. However, in fact, because the analysis included several smoking bans introduced in different countries in different years, most saw improvements in health. Such findings are useful for countries and states where there is an ongoing debate about how strict smoking bans should be, especially since hospital care for premature babies is so expensive. This could be one of the most important things you need to know to strengthen your legislation. Other studies have shown that heart attack and stroke rates also tend to decline after smoking bans are introduced.",

The law, to be passed this month, is likely to spark a revolution in family affairs in a country where 40% of men reportedly do no domestic work. It will oblige men to \"share the domestic responsibilities and the care and attention\" of the children and the elderly in the family, according to the project approved by the justice commission of the Spanish Parliament. \" This will be a good way to remind people of their duties. It is something that feminists have been wanting for a long time, ”said Margarita Uria, of the Basque Nationalist Party, who was behind what is an amendment to a new divorce law. The judges will take into account the breach of the obligations when determining the terms of the divorces. Men who refuse to do their part may be given less frequent contact with their children. Spanish women spend five times more time on household chores than husbands. Even when both have jobs outside the home, Spanish women still do three times more work at home. \" However, it is not just about housework, \"said Ms. Uria. A study carried out five years ago by the Spanish Sociological Research Center concluded that parents spent an average of 13 minutes a day caring for their children. Only 19% of Spanish men thought it was right for mothers of school-age children to have a full-time job. More than a third thought mothers shouldn't work outside the home at all. The change to the Spanish legal code will add domestic obligations to a list of matrimonial duties that currently includes fidelity, coexistence and mutual aid. That should ensure that when the law, which will also make divorce proceedings faster and easier, is voted on in parliament in the coming weeks, the obligation to share housework will be added to the statutes.",

My train was running a little late, but that wasn't a big problem; I could text him to tell him I'd be late. He would understand. But ... where was my cell phone? He had that familiar sinking feeling. Yes, I had forgotten it at home. No mobile phone. I'm sure I'm not the only one feeling anxious and worried when I don't have my phone with me. In fact, I know I am not alone: two-thirds of us experience 'nomophobia', the fear of losing contact with the mobile phone. That's according to a 2012 study that surveyed 1,000 people in the UK about their relationship to mobile phones. It says that we check our mobile phones 34 times a day, that women are more 'nomophobic' than men, and that people between the ages of 18 and 24 are the most likely to be afraid of being left without their cell phones: 77% of them It says yes. unable to be separated from their phones for more than a few minutes. Do you have nomophobia? * You never turn off your phone * You obsessively check text messages, missed calls and emails * You always take your phone to the bathroom with you * You never let the battery run out It's funny to think that about 20 years ago the only people with cell phones would be entrepreneurs who they will carry their big plastic \"bricks\". Of course, these days, mobile phones are everywhere. A UN study this year said mobile phone subscriptions would outnumber people worldwide by the end of 2014. And when there are more phones than people in the world, maybe it's time to ask who is really in charge. Are you in control of your phone or is your phone in control of you? So what happened to my friend from college? When I was a few minutes late, he laughed and said, \"You haven't changed at all, it's still always late!\" And we had a great afternoon catching up, full of jokes and stories, uninterrupted and not wanting to check my phone. Not having him with me felt strangely liberating. Maybe I'll leave it home on purpose next time.",

Jazz was invented in the city a few years before its birth. Armstrong used to say, \"Jazz and I grew up together.\" Armstrong demonstrated a great talent for music when he was taught to play the cornet in a child's home. In his late teens, Armstrong began living the life of a musician. He played in parades, clubs, and on the steamboats that traveled down the Mississippi River. At the time, New Orleans was famous for new jazz music and was home to many great musicians. Armstrong learned from the older musicians and soon became respected as their equal. In 1922 he went to Chicago. There begins the story of Louis Armstrong. From then until the end of his life, Armstrong was famous and loved wherever he went. Armstrong had no equal when it came to playing the American folk song. His cornet playing had a deep humanity and warmth that made many listeners say, \"Listening to Pops just makes you feel good. \"He was the father of the jazz style and also one of the best known and most admired people in the world.

          "context": "You are in your office when you learn that there is someone with a gun wandering outside. You can hear gunshots and screams. What do you do for a living? That's the challenge for users of a new virtual reality program called SurviVR, designed to train employees on how to deal with an active shooter situation in the workplace. The program works with HTC Vive, the virtual reality headset launched earlier this year. An active shooter situation is when an armed person or persons actively shoot in a small, populated area with the intent to kill. There were 20 such situations in the United States last year and 20 the year before, according to FBI statistics, resulting in a total of 231 deaths. This year saw the deadliest active shooter situation in American history, with 49 people killed in an Orlando nightclub. In the training situation, users have four options. They can lock themselves in the office. They can hide, maybe in the office closet. They can run for an exit. Or they can use something in the office, a computer or a mug or a pair of scissors, as a weapon to fight the shooter. This is an improvement on standard active shooter training. Gallo says, that he generally teaches people to lock themselves in a place and hide. The \"lockdown\" method is often ineffective, he says, and has led to many deaths in recent years. At the basic level of training, no one dies. But as workouts get more advanced, players who make the wrong decision get shot. There is no blood; the screen just slowly turns black. If this sounds scary, that's the point, says Gallo. There are many training programs to teach employees how to deal with violence in the workplace, sometimes with role-playing games with toy guns. But these workouts are basically games. Gallo says, with employees relaxed and even enjoying themselves. To teach people what they really need to know for an active shooter situation, they must be afraid. \" SurviVR will take fear and turn it into confidence. \" Rooster says.",

How much do you know about the Scandinavian country? Denmark is famous for its design culture. At the heart of \"Danish Design\" is the idea that, as the poet and designer Piet Hein says: \"There is an art, no more, no less, [and it is] doing all things naively.\" Danish design places the same emphasis on practicality and quality. From Lego toys to furniture, Danish products are known for their clean lines, simplicity, and functionality. \" Remove material where it is not needed. Keep things simple and functional and do them carefully, \"explained Hans J. Wegner, the first Danish designer to achieve world fame:\" The goal is not to create a work of art, but to produce a good chair. \" The Danes have done a better job than most in promoting the arts in Europe, considering the size and population of their country, in the fields of architecture, sculpture and design, ”writes Helena Smith, a reporter for the newspaper. British The Guardian. The simplicity of Danish design can be extended to the quality of life there. Some even claim that the Danes have the best quality of life of any nation in the world. Kate Vial, a 55-year-old American who has lived and worked in Denmark for over 30 years, and explained why she chooses to live in Denmark rather than the US, told Germany's top news weekly Der Spiegel : \"I just chose a lifestyle, one where I can ride my bike everywhere and where I don't have to earn a living to survive.\"",

It's on the fifth floor and ... guess what? ... We are not allowed to use the elevator. I could not believe it. When we were going up all the stairs, I started talking to another guy who didn't know anyone. He said his family had moved from Hong Kong over the summer. It looked really nice, so we sat together when we got to our classroom, out of breath! He said his English was very poor but I thought it was really good. We spent the entire morning with Mrs. Black looking at our schedules. Everyone at school has a different schedule, can you believe it? Half of the school is learning Spanish as a second language and the other half is learning French. I'm in the Spanish group, which sounds like fun. I worry about forgetting my schedule and going to the wrong room! How will someone help me if no one else has the same hours as me? Lunch time was fine. After lunch we started the lessons. It had math, which was complicated and difficult, and then history, where we started learning about ancient Greece. That seems interesting.

They drink champagne, dance and cheer on the stroke of midnight. Fireworks, which in ancient times drove away evil spirits, are very popular in the US. Residents of the US often celebrate one or more New Years _ like promising to quit smoking, lose weight, stop drinking. Most of these resolutions last just over a month. In the southern United States, many people eat black-eyed peas for good luck in the new year. In Mexico and Venezuela, many people wear red or yellow underwear for good luck. In Brazil, residents wear red white clothes for good luck, and in China, they wear red clothes and give children red envelopes with money in them. In Iran, people wear new clothes on the first day of the new year. In Scotland, homeowners open the front door at midnight to let in the new year and open the back door to let out the old year. In Switzerland, people kiss three times at midnight. In Spain, people eat 12 grapes - one per bell - while the clock strikes midnight. In Japan, they ring 108 times to get rid of 108 bad wishes that people have. In Korea, a bell is rung 33 times in honor of 33 ancient soldiers.",

Klose said that Volvo Cars had entered a new era of rapid development, adding that its sales volume in China in 2010. Through the end of September, Volvo's global sales volume increased 12.5 percent year-on-year, compared with a 52 percent year-on-year increase in China, it said. Two new Volvo sales centers opened in Beijing in just a week in early October, about two months after Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co in eastern China acquired the Swedish brand from American auto giant Ford for $ 1.5 billion in early August. Klose said he was confident that he would see tremendous growth in China's auto market in the next five years. \" As the Chinese government has already raised the tax rate for large-cylinder cars, we now have a lot of cars below three liters, and I think we will stick to that strategy, as you can see now, the XC60 that was introduced today is just two liters, \"he said.\" As technology advances, we will probably see 1.6-liter engines or 1.5-liter engines in the future, \"he added. Volvo Cars is not the only automaker hoping to take advantage of the rapid growth of China's auto market.

Popular wisdom says that parents' relationships can suffer once their children flee from the cooperative, because they feel they have lost their purpose in life. However, a new study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, has found that many couples feel happier when their children leave home because they can enjoy spending time together. In total, 123 American mothers born in the 1930s were tracked for 18 years and asked to rate their satisfaction levels shortly after they were married, when they were raising babies, once their children reached their teens, and finally their teens. 61 years, when almost all had turned. \"empty nests\". Although not all said they were happier overall, most said that their marriages had improved since their children left home. Researchers believe this is not just because the spouses spent more time together, but because they were able to enjoy each other's company more. One of the study participants, which is published in the journal Psychological Science, said: \"Once kids get older ... some of that stress is removed ... that responsibility is removed, so things are a bit more relaxed. \" Psychologist Sara Gorchoff, who conducted the research, said: \"The take-home message for couples with young children is 'hang on.' His co-author Oliver John added, \"Don't wait until your kids leave home to schedule quality time with your partner.\" However, Dr Dorothy Rowe of the British Psychological Society said that the effects of living in an \"empty nest\" will depend on the parents' relationship with their children. \"If you are just waiting for them to leave home so you can get on with your life, then of course you will be happy to see them go,\" he said, \"but if you have built your life around your children you will be terribly lonely. For some parents, their world falls apart when their children leave. \"",

According to the California Department of Public Health, these people were exposed to the disease at Disneyland from December 17-20.

Measles spreads very easily. It can be contracted by coughing and sneezing. Busy areas like theme parks are especially suitable for its spread. The disease starts with a fever and develops into symptoms including cough, runny nose, red eyes, etc. About three out of ten people infected with measles will develop another health problem, including an ear infection or pneumonia.

The gasoline-electric hybrid car is exactly what it sounds like: a cross between a gasoline car and an electric car. A gasoline car has a fuel tank, which supplies gasoline to the engine. An electric car, on the other hand, has a set of batteries that provides electricity for the car. To be of use to you or me, a car must be able to run at least 300 miles (483 km) before refueling, able to refuel quickly and easily, and fast enough to keep up with other traffic on the road. A gasoline car meets these requirements but produces a large amount of pollution. An electric car, however, produces almost no pollution, but can only go 50 to 100 miles (80 to 161 km) between recharges. And the problem has been that the electric car is very slow and uncomfortable to recharge. A gasoline-electric car combines the advantages of the two power sources in a system that uses gas power and electric power. Some experts believe that the hybrid car is \"the next generation of smart cars.\" A hybrid car can go up to 50% further than a traditional car on the same amount of gas!

Many of these animals are not only expert climbers, but have also found interesting ways to get from tree to tree. How do animals adapt and how do animals move? are in-depth explorations of the adaptations and movement of animals for young readers. Both are part of a series of 21 books, The Science of Living Things. Readers of How Do Animals Adapt? These adaptations are well explained on double-page spreads with examples clearly represented in photographs and diagrams and developed through the accompanying captions. As the title suggests, movement is the central theme of How do animals move? Starting with a description of the explanation of movement, the reader is exposed to the different forms of movement of animals in the air, on land, underground and in water. Several unconventional variations are included (eg, inchworm loops, rectilinear motion of snakes). Once again, the photographs and diagrams clearly support double-page discussions of animal movement. The language of both titles is simple enough for young readers without belittling them. In both books, the terminology appears in. Some of these words are explained in the basic glossary, while most are clearly explained in the text. Many of these terms provide readers with some fascinating and unusual words (for example, brachiation, potassium, skein, and estimate). Like many of Kalman's books, both titles have an index, a glossary, and an index that are sufficient to introduce young readers to the nature of these tools. Both titles would make great additions to any science collection for young readers.",

One day, I complained to my father about having to go milk those cows, saying it was exhausting. He said, you know, boy, working is a blessing. I looked at the men who had worked the hardest. I had the feeling that something really important had been said to me, but it was many years before it was assimilated. Back then, going to college was a rare privilege. My father told me that if I chose something to study that I liked to do, he would always look forward to my work. But he also added that even having a job that you hate is better than not having a job at all. I wanted to be a farmer, but I joined a military program to help pay for college. And what started as an obligation to the Army became a way of life that I had dedicated myself to for 37 years. In the late 1980s, during a visit to Bangladesh, I saw a woman with her baby on her back, breaking bricks with a hammer. I asked a local officer why they weren't using a machine to make the job easier. He told me that a machine would put that lady out of work. And as bad as that woman's job was, it was enough to keep a small family alive. It reminded me of my father's words: working is a blessing. After seeing many people like that woman in Bangladesh, I have come to believe that people without work are not free. They are victims of crime, poor health, and depression. People who have jobs can have a home, send their children to school, develop a sense of pride, contribute to the good of the community, and even help others. When we can work, we are free.

          "context": "Everyone wants to know the secrets of a long and healthy life. Here are some discoveries from health experts. Many studies investigating the lives of centenarians look at what they eat. Many people living in the hundreds live in the Mediterranean, so their diet, which is rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and healthy fats like olive oil, receives a lot of attention. Diet has been linked to healthier old age, lower risk of heart disease, and even protection against memory loss. Education is related to a longer life. A 2012 report from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics found that people with a bachelor's or higher degree live about nine years longer than people who don't graduate from high school. James Smith, a health economist at RAND Corporation, also supports the argument to stay in school for better life expectancy. Their findings show that education should be an even more important factor than race and income. Educated people are more likely to get better jobs, plan for their futures, and choose healthier lifestyles. Being a hard worker doesn't necessarily mean that job stress hurts you. The longevity study found that many workers lived long lives. \" Skeptics may wonder if hard workers really enjoy life. \" The authors write: \"We found that productive and hardworking people (even in old age) are not stressed or miserable, but tend to be happier, healthier, and more socially connected than their less productive peers.\" Having a strong social group is associated with a longer life. We often turn to friends and family for support, and taking care of the people we care about can help us take better care of ourselves, some evidence shows. Some research even suggests that immune function improves when we are around our friends and that they help manage stress. Research shows that sitting for a long period of time puts people at risk for shorter lifespan and other health risks. A 2011 study found that every hour people spent sitting and watching television after age 25 was related to 22 minutes of their overall life expectancy.",

The 17-year-old defeated champion Serena Williams 6-1 6-4 in the Wimbledon final on Saturday in London to become the first Russian to win a single championship title. A ray of light for a depressing, rain-beaten Wimbledon, she has raised a burning passion. However, nobody was complaining, because the 1.83 meter Sharapova has created a wave of interest in tennis, something that was lacking in recent years. Not even Anna Kournikova evoked such passion when she burst onto the scene. Looking good on the court is one thing, but Sharapova can play the game too. Extremely well. He proved it for 13 days in the most prestigious tournament in the world. Playing tennis of the highest quality at all times, the Russian's triumph not only lifted the tournament out of rain-induced bouts of depression, but also saved (;) the season for the women's tour. Sharapova did not have an easy road in the tournament as she had to beat 1999 champion Lindsay Davenport in the semifinals and two-time champion Serena Williams for the title. Neither of them caused him much concern. \" I don't remember much about the final, \"Sharapova laughed.\" I was in my own place. \" She will find it increasingly difficult to find a place to call hers from now on, after advertisers have identified her as the most marketable woman in sport.

Sharapova will return to her foster home in Florida knowing that life will never be the same again. But the girl who came to the United States at age seven with her father for just $ 700 is determined not to let fame and wealth detract from her number one love, tennis. \" I know that things will start to emerge and that many more things will want to get involved, but I want to keep a cool head and play tennis, \"he said.",

If you are afraid of not disciplining your children enough, the evidence of parental failure is there for everyone. The girl is not completing her applications for college! If you are afraid that you have allowed your children to watch too much television and settle for low grades, you will have to answer for the consequences. The excessive involvement of many parents in the process is, from my perspective, a cover for this deep parental anxiety: Did I do a good job with this child? Did I do everything I had to do for this child? Is this kid going to have a good life? I have seen many parents immerse themselves in their children's lives upon admission to college, trying to infuse all their wisdom and discipline into their children at the last minute. When their children leave the nest, the parents may need to make sure that they have actually taught them to fly. Since it is impossible to assess the quality of what parents have done for their children at this time, the best is the state of the school where the child is admitted. From the point of view of an anxious parent, an \"ivy, eague college\" child is proof of better parenting than a \"little college\" child. I once sat with a talented and weak older girl and her brilliant parents. She, they, and the school had to decide whether to stay in school or go to a hospital. In light of her anorexia (), the school strongly recommended that she not submit her advance application to Princeton. Hearing this, the girl looked at the adults in the room and said, \"If I can't apply for Princeton early, I'll die.\" His parents were also eager for him to enter Princeton. Why did everyone need this so desperately? Because, in this case, something was wrong in the family. Due to some weakness in her upbringing, this girl was neither happy nor confident. However, he was eighteen years old, the culture required that he leave home. The psychological solution for all of them was the comforting vision of a great university. Going there would somehow make life good for him and defend the raising of his parents' children. Those fears of letting a child go without delivery exist in all families. How can we let go of a child who is still so young in so many ways? It is painful and has no cure except time and hope. For parents looking for a pain reliever, the college admissions process is where they can resolve their anxieties.",

My wife and I wanted to give James the best education, but that meant we would have to change our jobs and spend less time with our son. I asked myself, \"Was this compensation worth it?\" When I look at research on child development, I think it may not. Where our children go to school may matter less than most American parents think. Social scientists have long tried to determine why some children grow up to be successful. In a 2001 study, Greg Duncan, a professor of education at the University of California, measured the influence that people in a child's life have on the child's performance in school. Duncan and his team found almost no relationship between the students' performance on the test and who they sat with in class, who they hung out with after school, and who lived on their block. The only significant link they found was between siblings and twins in particular. For a long time, academics thought that a family's income greatly affected children's performance in life. But that may not be the case. When Susan Mayer of the University of Chicago analyzed the relationship between family income and lifetime achievement, she conducted a series of experiments to measure it and found that those results were not due to income. She argued that the things that make a difference are relatively inexpensive: the number of books a child has or how often their family goes to museums. Lareau, another scholar began one of the most profound observations of parenting in America. He concluded that success is much more related to the amount of time parents spend with their children. He said: \"Many parents I interviewed are anxious about their children's future. But they have exaggerated the sense of the risks involved if they don't give their children the 'best' of everything. \" So we finally decided to leave things as they were. More time with our son is the best we can offer.",

However, these ratings were given to the teachers. At the end of the year, the experimenters compared the students' performance with the grades. Despite his actual abilities, there was a staggeringly high connection between performance and grades. People seem to perform as well as we expect. The Self-fulfilling Effect is also known as the Pygmalion Effect. This comes from an old Greek story. The story was also the basis for George Bernard Shaw's \"Pygmalion\", which later became the musical \"My Fair Lady.\" In Shaw's work, Professor Henry Higgins claims that he can turn a Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, into a duchess. But, as Eliza herself points out to Higgins's friend Pickering, it is not what she learns or does that determines whether she will become a duchess, but how she will be treated. The implication of the Pygmalion Effect for leaders and managers is enormous. It means that the performance of your team depends less on them than on you. The return you get from people is neither more nor less than you expect, which means you should always hope for the best. As Goethe said: \"Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is.\" Treat a man as he can and should be and he will become what he can and should be. \"",

You may be wondering why you should study abroad. Here are some answers. * Time The best time of your life to study abroad is when you are in college. If you miss this opportunity, it is almost impossible for you to do so later in life. * For an intercultural experience Life abroad makes you see your everyday world in a whole new light. You don't even realize it, but our culture shapes the way we see the world and affects us every minute of the day. Differences in culture are more than differences in language, food, clothing, and art. * To improve your communication skills and self-confidence People who study abroad tend to be willing to take risks, put themselves in unusual situations and solve problems. * To master a language or learn a new language The world market is getting smaller and smaller and many companies require a second language. Foreign languages are not only valuable in the job market, but also in the real world. * For adventure Travel to other cities within your host country and around neighboring countries. As you meet your new classmates, roommates, and host family, you will gain a unique insight into the host culture. Discover the differences and, more importantly, the many similarities between their worlds. The friendships you make will last long after the show. * To learn more about yourself, find out who you really are. What are your limits? How do you overcome difficulties that you have never _ before? How independent are you? These questions are difficult to answer until you are removed from your usual environment. After solving difficult problems on your own abroad, you will find that almost nothing will confuse you at home. Students studying abroad commonly report that their study abroad experience really changed their lives.",

The London 2012 Organizing Committee (Locog) confirmed on Wednesday that an error in the sale of its tickets had caused four synchronized swimming competitions to be oversold by 10,000 entries. Locog and his ticket sales agent spent the Christmas period contacting ticket holders and offering them alternatives that included the tickets they had requested but to no avail. The hangers do not need any additional cost. He has also offered to return any discrepancies if the new tickets cost less than the originals. Locog said the replacement tickets would come from various unsold seats at the Olympics and _ was doing everything it could to make up for the mistake of the ticket-buying fans. Locog said the error occurred in the summer, between the first and second round of ticket sales, when a staff member made a mistake, entering \"20,000\" into the computer instead of the correct figure of 10,000 remaining tickets. The error was discovered when Locog checked the number of tickets that had been sold against the final seat numbers and began contacting ticket holders before Christmas. Thousands of ticket holders have already gotten lucky, switching to tickets for major events like the swimming and track finals, and in around 200 cases the hottest of all, the men's 100-meter final. Locog said the decision to award final 100-meter tickets was made because one of the synchronized swimming competitions was the same afternoon as the event, on Aug. 5.",

Tests in rats show that rats that raise two or more litters of puppies perform considerably better on memory and skill tests than rats that do not have babies, and their brains show changes that suggest they may be protected against diseases such as Alzheimer's . Psychology professor Craig Kinsley believes his findings will translate into humans. \"Our research shows that pregnancy hormones protect the brain, including estrogen, which we know has many neuroprotective effects,\" Kinsley said. \" They are data from rats, but humans are mammals just as these animals are mammals, \"he added in a telephone interview. \"They go through pregnancy and hormonal changes.\" Kinsley said she hopes researchers and public health officials will see if having children protects a woman from Alzheimer's and other age-related forms of brain decline. \" When people think of pregnancy, they think of what happens to babies and to the mother from the neck down, \"said Kinsley, who presented his findings at the annual meeting of the Society for Neurosciences in Orlando, Florida.\" They don't realize that hormones are brainwashing. If you look at females who have never been pregnant, they act differently with the young. But if you go through pregnancy, you will sacrifice your life for your baby; that's a big change in their behavior that manifested itself in genetic alterations in the brain. \"",

          "context": "Five or six years ago I attended a conference on the science of attention. A professor conducting research in medical school spoke of attention blindness, the basic characteristic of the human brain that, when we focus on one task, causes us to lose almost everything else. Since we cannot see what we cannot see, our lecturer was determined to surprise us on the spot. He had us watch a video of six people throwing basketballs back and forth, three in white shirts and three in black, and our task was to only keep track of the throws among people in white. The tape rolled and everyone started counting. All except I. I'm dyslexic, and the moment I saw that tape with the confused basketball shooters, I knew I wouldn't be able to follow their movements, so I let my mind wander. However, I was curious when, approximately 30 seconds into the recording, a gorilla entered among the players. She (we later learned that a student was wearing the gorilla suit) stared at the camera, hit her chest with her fist, and then left as the balls continued to pass. When the tape stopped, the teacher asked how many people had counted at least a dozen basketball throws. Hands went up everywhere. Then he asked who had counted 13, 14 and congratulated those who got the perfect 15. Then he asked, \"And who saw the gorilla?\" I raised my hand and was surprised to find that I was the only person at my table and one of the three or four in the great room who did. He set us up, trapping us in our own attention blindness. Yes, there had been a trick, but he wasn't the one who played it on us. By concentrating so hard on counting, we had managed to miss the gorilla in the middle. Attention blindness is the fundamental organizing principle of the brain and I think it presents us with a great opportunity. My opinion is different from that of many neuroscientists: where they see the deficiencies of the individual, I perceive an opportunity for cooperation. Fortunately, given the interactive nature of most of our lives in the digital age, we have the tools to control and take advantage of our different forms of attention. It's not easy to admit that everything we've learned about paying attention means we've missed everything else. It's not easy for us logical, smart, and confident types to admit that the key to our success - our ability to discover a problem and solve it, an accomplishment earned in all those years in school and beyond - may be exactly what limits.

Mr. Belser, who lived in the same neighborhood as them, spent as much time as he could to ensure that Jack had the influence of a man in his life. He spent a lot of time teaching Jack that he thought about what was important in his next life. If Mr. Belser hadn't taught you to knit, you wouldn't be in this business now.

The night before he was to return home, Jack and his mother stopped by to see the old house that Mr. Belser once lived in. Now it belonged to him. He bought the house of one of his own. The house was exactly as I remembered it. Each step contained memories. Every image, every piece of furniture ... Jadk stopped suddenly. The box on his desk was gone!

Three days later, when he returned home from work, Jack discovered a small package in his mailbox. The handwriting was difficult to read, but the sender caught his eye. \"Mister.

With lower quality lenses and image sensors, smartphones probably won't replace professional video cameras any time soon. Still, some creative filmmakers are pushing the boundaries of smartphone movie making by shooting professional-quality movies using only smartphones. Shortly after the release of Apple's iPhone 4, two filmmakers decided to make a short film using only their iPhone 4s. Michael Koerbel and Anna Elizabeth James shot and edited the 1.5-minute Apple of My Eye movie in just 48 hours. Audiences were fascinated by the film, in which a man and his grandfather connect emotionally while admiring a model train in a store window. The filmmakers followed their success with Goldilocks, an extraordinary spy novel told in nine three-minute films. Many filmmakers are convinced that smartphone movies are here to stay. One sign is its inclusion in major film festivals. In February 2012, the organizers of the Berkshire International Film Festival organized the 10 X 10 On North Festival. The works included Oliver from Hooman Khalili, an award-winning film about a girl whose special powers allow her to brighten the lives of three lonely people. Another entry was Yearlapse'11, a 365-second film by Zsolt Haraszti that describes an actual trip he made from New York to London. During the festival, which ran from February 16-26, these and many other smartphone movies were screened at the Beacon Cinema in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Similar festivals in Canada and South Korea have given smartphone filmmakers an opportunity to showcase their creative work.",

At this stage, we will operate services with stops at all stations that will depart at the same time in the hour, however, all this is subject to weather conditions and the availability of trains. \" Mr. Scurrah encouraged all customers to visit the Translink website for their station's specific departure times and asked for patience in case of delays. \" Queensland Rail recognizes that reduced services can cause disruptions, but it is simply unavoidable. We have a dedicated and experienced team monitoring the situation 24 hours a day and we will work to reopen the network as soon as possible, \"said Scurrah. The latest information on service interruptions is available on the TransLink website www.translink.com.au.",

          "context": "Is it time to get Russia out of the BRICs? If so, you may end up sounding like a famous pen maker - BIC. It is being argued that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device, the BRICs, should really be the BICs. \" Is it really worth calling Russia BRIC? \" asks Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreign Policy. Aslund, who also co-authored \"The Russian Balance Sheet\" with Andrew Kuchins, believes Putin and Medvedev's Russia is simply not worthy of being included alongside Brazil, India and China on the list of future economic powers. He writes: \"The economic performance of the country has fallen to such a weak level that one must wonder if it has something to say about the global economy, compared to the other members of its group. I just got back from Moscow, which is always boring this season. Over the past seven years, Russia has taken very little action to improve its economy. Instead, the state has been living off oil and gas. \" Financially, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund estimates that the Russian economy will fall 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There are fewer arguments for Brazil, down 0.7 percent, but it is still doing much better than Russia. But the BRICs are not just about economics. As mentioned above, it is a marketing device to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment point of view, it could be argued that Russia leads the BRICs. Its stock market is up 128 percent this year, while about 80 percent is for the other three. At least, despite Russia's poor economic performance, its outperformance on the stock market suggests that it is indeed one of the bunch.",

But experts now warn that current shoe fads will cause short-term discomfort for teens and accumulate years of foot, knee, and back pain in the future. Here, experts identify the problems caused by teenagers' shoe choice. KEDS / VANS Slip-ons with elastic sides are particularly popular with teens, with Keds and Vans being the most sought-after brands. The main problem is that they are too flat, so flat that the heel, which hits the ground first, is also damaged and sore. BALLET PUMPS The worst shoes of all are the lightweight, slim platform shoes. The problem is partly its flatness, as with Keds and Vans. However, ballet shoes, which do not have a string or heel, have other specific problems. \" As the shoe does not have a holding device, it relies on the toes to keep the shoe on, which causes an uncomfortable gait, this leads to short-term and long-term problems such as calluses, heel and knee pain. \" WEDGES AND STILETTOS These shoes can also cause gait problems. They may look good, but the heels are so high that they can force the wearer's body weight forward, making them very unstable. Teens who wear these shoes regularly are also in danger of joining those millions of women with constant back pain. SCHOOL SHOES So what do podiatrists have on their bucket list, especially for everyday wear? Something made of natural and breathable fabric, with a string to hold it, with a small heel and a deep toe that does not put pressure on the fingers, like Clark's, Marks & Spencer or Rhino. If your teenager insists on wearing \"bad\" shoes, get him some simple foot braces in the shoes. These support and correct foot movement and, properly positioned by a podiatrist, can often transform your gait and stop the damage.",

The typical classroom used to be the place where teachers and students worked and explored the wonderful world of knowledge together, but now everything has changed. The Internet is one of those approaches. Learning through the Internet is a new style that seems to be more successful than traditional teaching. The Internet provides schools with a wealth of learning material that students can access online. Due to online course options, completing a program becomes much easier. We used to go to the library when we needed information and spend hours searching for the right sources. Today there is a \"library\" in our house and it is available 24 hours a day. From my personal experience, as a new mother, I find using the information online to be very helpful. While at home with my baby, I can still find the supplies I need and exchange thoughts and information with my classmates without leaving my home. The Internet is not only a great provider of information, but also a time and money saver. People predict that education will be much cheaper in the future due to access to information over the Internet. The cost of land, construction, and teachers' salaries are continually increasing. Additionally, regular (offline) courses rely heavily on books and other paper materials, while online education publishes lectures and assignments electronically, saving thousands of dollars each year. With no physical restrictions, Internet classes and courses are also very convenient. In classroom education there is a limitation on the number of students, while Internet education is available to everyone. Students don't have to struggle to enroll in the classes they like. Students will have more options to take their courses and classes online. The Internet offers a wonderful opportunity to gain knowledge in a more convenient and less expensive way.

Unfortunately, I am not good at any sport of any kind, much less parachute jumping. My friend, Mr. Smith, was willing to give me a hand. He took me to an elementary school. The first day's training included several hours of instruction, but it was not my first descent from an airplane. To do this, I had to wait until the next morning. The next morning, after a hasty and anxious breakfast, I was taken to the airfield. There, they placed two heavy parachutes on my back. Then they asked me to go to a small plane that had just slowly come to a stop on the runway. Once on the plane, he was soon climbing. I started to feel nervous. When we reached 1,000 meters, Harry, my teacher, hooked a line from my parachute to a steel ring inside the plane. The line was to open my parachute after jumping. \" Get ready, Henry, \"said Harry. I approached the door carefully. I wanted to cry: \"No, no, no!\" but no word came. \" Skip!\" Harry yelled out loud. \" Skip!\" To my surprise, kicking like a frog, I jumped. Away from the plane, and down, I fell. It worked! The air seemed to hold me. I was very happy. Then I felt a quick tug. My big parachute had opened! It was like the best surprise I had ever had.

There are states where the white man imposes his dominion by force; there are states where the Negro protests by burning cities and looting and looting. Important people on both sides, who in other respects seem like reasonable men, stand up and calmly argue in favor of violence, as if it were a legitimate solution, like any other. What is really scary, what really fills you with despair, is the realization that when it comes to the crisis, we have not made any real progress at all. We can wear collars and ties instead of war paint, but our instincts remain basically unchanged. All the recorded history of the human race, that tedious documentation of violence, has taught us absolutely nothing. We have not yet learned that violence never solves a problem, but makes it worse. Sheer horror, bloodshed, suffering mean nothing. No solution comes to light the next morning as we gaze sadly at the smoking ruins and wonder what hit us. Truly reasonable men who know where the solutions lie are finding it increasingly difficult to get an audience. They are looked down upon, distrustful, and even persecuted by their own kind because they advocate seemingly outrageous things like law enforcement. If half of the energy that goes into violence was put to good use, if our efforts were directed at cleaning up dilapidated houses to improve living standards and provide education and employment for all, we would have come a long way to get there. to a solution. Our strength is weakened by having to clean up the mess that violence leaves in its wake. In a well-directed effort, it would not be impossible to meet the ideals of a stable social program. The benefits that can be derived from constructive solutions are evident in all parts of the world around us. Genuine and durable solutions are always possible, as long as we work within the framework of the law. Before we can begin to reflect on the peaceful coexistence between the races, we must appreciate the problems of others. And for this, we must know them: it is a simple exercise of communication, of information exchange. \" Talk, talk, talk, \"say advocates of violence,\" all you do is talk and we don't realize it. \" It is more like the story of the famous lawyer who carefully explained his case to the judge. After listening to a long discussion, the judge complained that after all this talk, he didn't notice. \" It is possible, my lord, \"replied the lawyer,\" you do not find out, but surely much better informed.

Translation problems Sometimes it's the motto that doesn't work. No company knows this better than Pepsi-Cola, with its \"Come to Life with Pepsi!\" Bell. The campaign was so successful in the United States that Pepsi literally translated its slogan for its international campaign. As it turned out, the translations were not entirely correct. Pepsi begged the Germans to \"come out of the grave\" and told the Chinese that \"Pepsi brings your ancestors out of the grave.\" A picture is worth a thousand words. Other times, the problem is related to the packaging. A photo of a smiling baby has helped sell countless jars of Gerber baby food. When Gerber started selling baby food in Africa, they used the same packaging as in the US, with the smiling baby on the label. They later learned that in African countries, the picture on the jar shows what is in the jar, as many people cannot read.

Several days ago, I tried to enter an elevator with one of my arms secured in a bandage while carrying a computer bag in the other. Not being fast enough, I was passed by two young people who managed to get on the elevator before me. The elevator door didn't close until after I entered. Having already pressed their desired ground button, the youngsters eagerly waited for me to press the button to find out where I was going. If they had decided to help, we could have gone much faster. But they hadn't. So I did my best and hit the button with my arm. The two young people looked very angry with me. I was losing heart. The memory of this incident stuck with me because it followed shortly after my building warden refused to help me carry a heavy box full of books. He replied that he could not carry the books a few feet away because it was not his job. However, I remembered helping people for so many years carrying boxes, shopping bags or pushing wheelchairs at the request of a stranger in need or when my conscience called me. \" Oh, this young generation, they have no manners, ”said my grandmother. The idea of good manners refers to taking into account the feelings of others. More and more people need to have good manners. Good manners should be part of our lives.",

          "context": "Where do dogs come from? Gray wolves are their ancestors. Scientists are pretty consistent on this. And researchers have suggested that the dogs' origins can be traced back to Europe, the Near East, Siberia, and southern China. Central Asia is the newest and the best candidate, according to a large study of dogs from around the world. Laura M. Shannon and Adam R. Boyko of Cornell University, along with an international group of other scientists, have studied not only purebred dogs, but also street or village dogs. Dr Shannon analyzed three different types of DNA, Dr Boyko said, the first time this has been done for such a large and diverse group of dogs from 38 countries. And this led them to Central Asia as the place of origin of dogs, in the same way that genetic studies have located the origin of modern humans in East Africa. The scan, said Dr Boyko, highlighted Central Asia as the place of origin of \"all dogs alive today\". The data does not allow an accurate dating of the origin, he said, but shows that it happened at least 15,000 years ago. Greger Larson of the University of Oxford, who is leading a large international effort to analyze ancient DNA from fossilized bones, said he was impressed with the study. \" It's really great to see not only the number of street dogs but also the geographic extent and the number of remote locations where the dogs have been sampled, ”he said in an email. He also praised the sampling of different types of DNA and the analytical methods. Dr Larson, who was not involved in the study, said he believed the discovery of Central Asia required further testing. He said he suspected that the origins of modern dogs were \"extremely messy\" and that no sampling of living populations will be definitive. He said a combination of modern and ancient DNA studies is needed.",

After writing numerous letters requesting admission to medical schools, she was finally accepted by a doctor in Philadelphia. She was so determined that she taught in school and gave music lessons to get money for school fees. In 1849, after obtaining her medical degree, she decided to continue her studies in Paris. She wanted to be a surgeon, but a serious eye problem forced her to give up the idea. Upon her return to the United States, she struggled to start her own practice because she was female. In 1857 Elizabeth and her sister, also a doctor, along with another female doctor, succeeded in opening a new hospital, the first for women and children.

          "context": "Right now we're going to explain a very old saying that has had a big effect on rock-and-roll music. This saying is \"A rolling stone gathers no moss\". It has several meanings. One of the meanings is that a person who never settles in one place will not be successful. Another is that someone who is always on the move, with no roots in one place, avoids responsibility. This proverb is said to have been used for the first time in the 1500s. But in the 1960s, the phrase \"Rolling Stone\" became famous in the rock-and-roll music world. It became the name of a song, a rock band and a magazine. Experts say it all started with a song by American singer and guitarist Muddy Waters. He was one of the best blues musicians in the country until his death in 1983. His music has influenced singers like Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. In 1950, Muddy Waters recorded a song called \"Rolling Stone\". A British rock band is said to have taken their name from the song by Muddy Waters. The Rolling Stones first performed in 1962. The band members called themselves \"the greatest rock and roll band in the world\". In 1965, Bob Dylan released his song \"Like a Rolling Stone\". It is one of his best known and most influential works. It's an angry song about a woman who was once rich and successful. But now she is alone, \"without direction at home, like a complete stranger, like a rolling stone\". In 1967, a young man by the name of Jann Wenner started a magazine and named it \"Rolling Stone\". The magazine reported on rock music and the popular culture created by music. By 1971, \"Rolling Stone\" had become the leading publication for rock music and counterculture. It is still popular today.",

          "context": "Tobacco companies are fighting efforts in the United States and Australia to make their products less attractive. In Washington, a federal judge last week banned the Food and Drug Administration from requiring new warning labels on cigarette packages. Judge Richard Leon has ruled in a case brought by five tobacco companies. The judge has temporarily stopped a new federal rule that requires important new warnings from next September. These include color1 images such as a dead body or diseased lungs. And simple text warnings now appear. Congress requested color1 images showing the dangers of smoking, as Canada is doing. But tobacco companies say new requirements approved in June violate their constitutionally guaranteed free speech rights. Justice Leon said the FDA cannot demand the new labels until legal action against the government is decided. Some experts say the process could take years. The judge said he believed the cigarette companies were very likely to win their case. He said the images should be designed to appeal to emotions, rejecting the government's arguments that they should be purely factual. He accused the government of trying to use the labels to promote an \"obvious anti-smoking agenda?\" The leader of an anti-smoking group, the Campaign for Tobacco Free Children, called the decision \"bad about science and bad about the law.\" About a fifth of American adults smoke. The World Health Organization says tobacco kills nearly six million people worldwide each year. More than six hundred thousand of them are non-smokers who inhale the tobacco smoke of others. In Australia, tobacco companies want to end what would be the world's most restrictive cigarette advertising laws. Cigarettes could only be sold in plain olive green packaging. Only the brand name and health warnings may appear. The Senate passed the bill last week and sent it back to the Lower House to approve minor amendments. The law is due to come into force in December of next year. Tobacco companies Say the law violates Australia's constitution. They say it would unfairly reduce the value of their brand names and brands. Health Minister Nicola Roxon says the government is ready for a legal battle.",

In the schools of ancient Greece and Rome, tests usually consisted of saying poetry out loud and giving speeches.

This custom exists today as part of the testing process of doctoral candidates. In general, however, modem reviews are written. The written exam, where all students are tested on the same questions, was probably only known in the 19th century. Perhaps it came into being with the sharp increase in population and the development of modern industry. A room full of candidates for a state exam timed exactly by electric clocks and closely watched by officials, looks like a group of workers in an auto factory. Certainly, during exams, teachers and students are expected to act like machines. One type of test is sometimes referred to as an \"objective\" test. It is intended to deal with facts and not personal opinions. To constitute an objective test, the teacher writes a series of questions, each of which has only one correct answer.

          "context": "An annoying problem for humans, who like to brag about all the distant planets and moons we've explored, is that we've never looked right under our noses. The interior of the earth is relatively close, but how do you get there? The deepest oil well penetrates just six miles into the crust (the center of the earth is about 4,000 miles deep). Russian scientists dug the deepest hole in Siberia, but reached the bottom about 7.5 miles below the surface. The Mohole Project, an American plan in the 1950s, called for drilling a hole 25 miles to the boundary between the hard crustal rocks and the soft mantle. Unfortunately, the project involved government support. It becomes harder and harder to dig deep into the earth because the rocks get softer and softer. Hard but easily broken on the surface, the rocks turn plastic at depth, and the pressure from the weight of the superimposed crust - about 52,800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles, makes further drilling impossible. What little we know about the earth's interior (such as that there is a crust, mantle, and core) comes from circumstantial evidence, such as analysis of earthquakes. So maybe it's time for a new, in-depth method of exploring the interior of the earth. Scientist David Stevenson says we should forget to drill holes. Instead, we should open a crack. Stevenson suggests digging a crack about half a mile long, one meter wide and half a mile deep (not with a shovel) but with a nuclear bomb-scale explosion. Then he poured a few hundred thousand tons of molten iron into the crack with a robot. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, would move downward at around 16 feet per second, taking the robot with it and opening the crack deeper and deeper. The mass of iron would drop for about a week and 2,000 miles from the outer edge of the Earth's core, with the robot sending data to the surface. Stevenson compares his idea to space exploration. \" We're going somewhere we haven't been before, ”he says. In any possibility, there will be surprises. \" This idea can probably be placed in the drawer marked with Is not Going To Happen. The robot would have to survive temperatures that would melt just about anything. But Stevenson's idea may inspire a new take on an old problem. Great things can come from what seem like impossible ideas.",

Those who don't believe in this idea are often heard saying \"if only it really worked.\" Well, in response to these people, there has been a lot of research into what happens to a person's feelings when asked to wear only one color1 of clothing. It has been proven that if we wear clothes of a particular color1, they can change our feelings. Suppose we are feeling sad, if we wear black we may start to feel worse. However, if we wear green, red, or yellow, we can start to feel better. It is said that each color1 has its own healing power.

The last 3 weeks of term 2 will be reserved for the introduction of writing for the TOEFL and the CEE. At this point, if the students have done their work correctly, they should be able to write fairly well. Regarding the Latin course, I will be posting notices on campus next week so that students understand what is on offer before I introduce the course. A number of students have already emailed me about the course. I'm sure you don't understand how important the opening of this program in our school is. People all over the world are interested in what we are planning to do. There are many rewards available for students who successfully complete the course. Please share what I said with the administration. I want them to understand the importance of this course. The reason I contacted these colleagues (actually Oxford contacted me) is that I trust our students and myself. I know that when these teachers meet our students and hear them speak and read Latin, they will be amazed. It will open all kinds of doors for students that they never even thought to knock on.

Going to a bar with friends is always enjoyable in a slightly different way. However, on the other hand, a table can also sometimes give us a lot of positive experiences. I just moved from NYC to the suburbs of Pennsylvania, it's been a change of pace, with positives and negatives, one of the best parts is that I'm spending more time outdoors. I really enjoy staying outside, especially eating out. My goal was to eat out as often as possible this summer, so one of my first purchases for the new house was a backyard table and set of chairs. Is my garden table a thing or an experience? This is clearly one thing and yet it allows for the experience of eating out. I love to eat outside, so my garden table is one of my favorite purchases. Therefore, I find that the dividing line between things and experiences is more nuanced than at first glance. However, the most important thing to be happy with is the type of purchases you have made. Sometimes we can all have purchases that seem like a waste of money, like probably half the clothes in our closets, but how is that? There are many reasons why this is happening. Most importantly, we spend a lot of our time working to earn money to buy things. The problem is, we buy a lot of things that we don't really need. There is nothing worse than looking in your closet and realizing how many hours you spent working to buy things you never wear. But how about a table that lets you enjoy the outdoors in the summer? It is worth every minute and every penny and you will get more happiness out of it as well.",

The problem is so serious that urgent action is needed, warns the study, conducted by British and Chinese researchers. The survey covered 2,191 students aged 9 to 12 at nine schools in Zhejiang, a thriving coastal province in eastern China. Eighty-one percent of young people said they worried \"a lot\" about exams, 63 percent feared being punished by their teacher, 44 percent had been bullied at least sometimes - boys were more likely to be victimized than girls - and 73 percent had been. physically punished by their parents. Most of the children complained that they struggled to cope with the amount of homework assigned to them. More than a third reported headaches or abdominal pain - psychosomatic symptoms of stress - at least once a week. The most stressed children reported an incidence of body aches or pains four times per week. The survey, led by Therese Hesketh, professor at the Center for International Health and Development at University College London (UCL), pointed to the extreme competitiveness of the Chinese education system, from the start of primary school. . \" The competitive and punitive educational environment leads to high levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms, ”say the authors. Measures to reduce unnecessary stress on children in schools should be urgently introduced. \" The article is published in Archives of Disease in Childhood, a peer-reviewed journal of the British Medical Association (BMA). The “urban” setting for the study was Hangzhou, the provincial capital of Zhejiang, while the “rural” setting was a poor county in Quzhou Prefecture, in the west of the province. The study highlights some of the complexities that, she says, explain the demands for academic excellence and the intolerance of failure. One of the factors is the dramatic increase in the country's prosperity, which has created \"hitherto unheard of opportunities for upward mobility\" and in turn fueled the pressures on children to do well at school. 'school. Other reasons are China's one-child policy and Confucian traditions of respect for parents and elders, filial piety, obedience and discipline. \" The aspirations of many parents, who themselves had limited educational opportunities, are now invested in their only children, ”he says. Previous studies on school stress and its impact on health are few and far between and generally come from Scandinavia. A 2008 assessment of children aged 10 to 13 in Sweden found that 21 percent of boys out of 30 percent of girls suffered from headaches, and 17 percent of boys and 28 percent of girls experienced headaches. abdominal pain at least once a week.",

The survey says the Olympics not only boosted China's image, but also served as an advertisement for Chinese tourism. The online survey was conducted among consumers in 16 countries and regions before the opening ceremony of the Games and after the closing. About 80% of those polled had not been to China before the events and 50% of them expressed hope to visit China after the Games. According to the survey, 70% of those polled felt that Beijing was more modern and scientific than they had thought. The most interested respondents came from Singapore, India, Mexico, South Africa and the Republic of Korea, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan in China. Pan Wen, head of Chinese tourism research at the Nielson Company, said the World Tourism Organization predicted that China would become the world's largest tourist attraction with 137 million foreign tourists each year. \" This figure would be achieved sooner with the help of the Beijing Olympics, ”said Pan.",

Robert Dane and his Solar Sailor recently received first prize at the Australian Design Awards. The Solar Sailor has been in use for six months. It uses four power sources for its power - solar, wind, battery power with stored solar power, and an in-store fuel generator, all controlled by computers. The ferry can travel up to 7.5 knots using wind and solar power alone. These are solar wings and fiberglass solar panels that not only absorb sunlight and store it in batteries, but also act as sails. \" We point our solar panels towards the sun in two planes, which increases the amount of energy we get from the sun by 40%, ”says Dane. And we can also use that same structure to do other work, which is also the sail, and so these winged sails actually push the ferry forward like a soft sail. \" Computers check the sun and wind and orient the solar wings to absorb the most sunlight. If there is not a lot of wind or if it is a cloudy day, the energy stored in the batteries keeps the electric motor running for up to five hours. \" If the batteries are too low, the computer turns on the generator so the boat will always be able to meet a commercial schedule or get from point A to point B no matter what, ”says Dan. Dane got his idea for the Solar Sailor from a book about insects. He was amazed at how the insects use their wings to collect solar energy for warmth. \" When I read this I realized that there was a good example in nature of what we were going to do, which was to use a solar wing to collect solar energy and also to navigate, ”says -he.",

Carnival celebrations are believed to have roots in the Saturnalia festival, which, adapted to Christianity, became a farewell to bad things in a season of religious discipline to regret and prepare for Christ's death and his return to life. The modern Brazilian carnival dates back to Rio de Janeiro in 1641. It originally copied the European form of the festival, later incorporating elements from Native American and African cultures. At the end of the 19th century, ropes were introduced to Rio de Janeiro. They were re-enactment groups that marched through the avenues of the city, playing on instruments and dancing. Today, they are known as blocks, which are a group of people who wear special costumes or T-shirts with themes or logos. Blocks are generally linked to particular neighborhoods; they include both a band and many revelers. Block parades have become an expressive feature of Rio Carnival. Today there are more than 100 and the groups are increasing every year. The blocks can be formed by small or large groups of revelers with a clear title. Before the show, they gather in a square, then parade through parts of the city, often near the beach. The Rio Carnival is very interesting, but it is also the most expensive time to visit Rio. Hotel rooms and other accommodation can be up to four times more expensive than regular rates. Some places are very crowded and life is far from ordinary in many parts of the city.",

It is argued that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device, the BRICs, should really be the BICs. \" Is Russia Really Worth the Name of BRIC? \" asks Anders Aslund, senior researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreigh Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of \"The Russian Balance Sheet,\" believes Putin and Medvedev's Russia is just not worthy of inclusion alongside Brazil, India and the United States. China in the list of future economic powers. He writes: “The country's economic performance has fallen to such a low level that one has to wonder if it has anything to say about the global economy, compared to other members of its group. I just got back from Moscow, which is still lackluster this season. In the past seven years, Russia has taken very little action to improve its economy. Instead, the state lives on oil and gas. \" Economically, Aslund has the numbers on her side. The International Monetary Fund estimates that the Russian economy will fall 6.7% in 2009, while China will grow 8.5% and India 5.4%. There are fewer cases for Brazil, with a drop of 0.7%, but it still does much better than Russia. But the BRICs are not just about the economy. As mentioned above, this is a marketing device to encourage investors to focus on the big, promising players. From an investment perspective, one could argue that Russia leads the BRICs. Its stock market is up 128% this year, while about 80% is for the other three. At the very least, however, Russia's economic underperformance and stock market outperformance suggest that it is indeed part of the group.",

          "context": "Many parents go to great lengths to protect their children from television and Internet advertising. But how do you protect a child from a large fast food ad painted on their school locker? Or a little ad on the side of his school bus? As school budgets shrink, an increasing number of schools in the United States are selling advertising space in lockers and buses and in gyms or cafeterias. It's an easy way for schools to make money. And the ads can provide relief to exhausted parents by donating cash to support schools. While parents can always turn off televisions or computers, they can't stop advertising from going out of schools. This is not the first time that the problem has arisen. For example, a teenage news program has been criticized for including advertisements in its 12-minute classroom shows. And parent groups have successfully fought a plan by a company called Bus Radio to put music and ads on school buses. But now things are different. Los Angeles last month approved a plan to allow businesses to advertise in schools in the district. Officials say the plan could provide schools with up to $ 18 million. In St. Francis, Minnesota, schools recently agreed to cover 10% to 15% of their lockers with advertisements. Time says. Edward Saxton, a teacher at the school, says: “So far parents have accepted this as a way to bring in the necessary money. The money is used to fund programs like the arts, sports and music. Parents don't like to see programs cut. Neither do I. In addition, schools are always thinking about the effects on children. \" However, Susan Linn, an education expert, says, “Kids have already seen enough ads on TV, in magazines and in the products they use every day. School is not a place for advertisements at all. \" Readers, what about you? Would you rather help organize another fundraiser at school or expose your child to advertisements on lockers and buses? Is it worth raising taxes or increasing your own financial support for the school through donations?",

The Belgian-born sociologist, whose research interests also include the fight against terrorism, international policing, the fight against crime and internet technology, says he has seen Lady Gaga in concert 30 times. \" We're going to treat Lady Gaga as a social event, ”Professor Deflem told USC student newspaper the Daily Gamecock.

As I walked through the courtyards, I noticed that Cambodian women spent hours carefully cleaning a small area of stone. Planks are laid to protect painted gemstones during repair work. There are very few machines and little heavy equipment. Workers carry construction materials in buckets at the end of long poles. Piles of stones lie in a corner of the yard, waiting to be replaced. The work of cleaning the stones is supervised by three Indian chemists. It is a very slow task. First, they clean the stones with brushes using buckets of a weak chemical. Then the spaces between the stones are filled. Finally, another material is painted on the stones that will protect them from water forever. Work begins every day at 7 a.m. mr. and continues until the end of the afternoon six days a week, with a lunch break. Evening is the best time to visit the temple, after the tour groups have left.

A good book can absorb our attention so completely that for the moment we forget our surroundings and even our identity. Reading good books is one of the greatest pleasures in life. It increases our satisfaction when we are happy and alleviates our problems when we are sad. Whatever our main goal in reading, our contact with good books should never fail to give us pleasure and satisfaction. With a good book in our hands, we should never be alone. Whether the characters are taken from real life or purely imaginary, they can become our companions and friends. In the pages of the books we can walk with the wise and good of all countries and all times. The people we meet in books may delight us either because they look like human friends who are dear to us, or because they feature unfamiliar types that we are happy to welcome as new acquaintances. Our human friends can annoy us sometimes, but the friends we make in books should never tire us of their company. By turning the page, we can dismiss them without fear of hurting their feelings. While human friends abandon us, the right books are always ready to bring us friendship, sympathy, and encouragement. Of all the gifts of reading books, the most valuable is experience. Few of us can travel far from home or have a wide range of experiences, but we can all lead varied lives through the pages of books. Whether we wish to escape the seemingly boring realities of daily grind or yearn to visit a faraway place, a book will help us when nothing else can. To travel with a book, we do not need a bank account to pay for our trip; no airship, ocean liner or river train to transport us; no passport to enter the country of our heart's desire. Thanks to books, we can have the thrill of adventure without danger. We can climb high mountains, brave the perils of an Antarctic winter, or traverse the scorching sands of the desert, all without difficulty. In the books we can visit the Hollywood studios; one can mingle with the joyful crowds of the Parisian boulevards; we can join the picturesque peasants in an alpine village or the gentle natives on an island in the South Sea. Indeed, through books _. The possibilities of our literary experiences are almost limitless. The beauties of nature, the pleasure of music, the treasures of art, the triumphs of architecture, the wonders of engineering, are all open to the wonder and pleasure of those who read.",

Airlines have stopped or altered flights across the Atlantic Ocean, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded at airports. Grimsvotn is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Europe. What makes Grimsvotn different is that it sits under a huge glacier of ice up to 12 meters thick. The hot volcano heats up the ice above it, which then forms a layer of water between the glacier and the volcano, keeping it stable. As the water flows under the glacier, the pressure rises. The lava from the volcano then rises to the surface. This is exactly what is happening today. Now, airlines must modify their flights so as not to fly through volcanic ash clouds. According to KLM, one of Europe's largest airlines, planes cannot pass under the cloud or overhead. Passing through the cloud can cause ash to jam in the aircraft engines, causing damage to the aircraft. The eruption also caused problems for animals in Iceland. The volcano left ash and sharp, glass-like rocks all over the countryside. Farmers keep their animals indoors to prevent them from eating grass covered with ash or sharp objects.",

One of the first attempts at traffic modeling was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham of the University of Manchester. They looked at traffic as a kind of liquid flowing through a pipe and looked at how the flow changes as the fluid becomes denser. At first the throughput increases as the density increases because you just get more stuff in the same period of time. But if the density becomes too high, there is a risk of jams, and the throughput drops sharply. Treiber's marathon model uses this same principle that throughput first increases and then decreases as runner density increases, with a sudden change from free flow to congested flow. It assumes that there is a range of different preferred speeds for different runners, which each maintains throughout the race. With just these factors, Treiber can calculate the runner's throughput, knowing the “load capacity” at each point on the route. This allows Treiber to understand how blocking can depend on race conditions - for example, for different starting procedures. Some marathons start by letting all of the runners go at once (meaning those behind have to wait until those ahead of them have advanced). Others assign runners to various groups based on their abilities and let them start with a series of waves. Treiber applied the model to the annual Rennsteig Half Marathon in central Germany, which attracts around 6,000 participants. The traditional route had to be changed in 2013 as police were no longer willing to close a road to ensure runners could cross safely. It could pass either over a 60 m wooden bridge or through a tunnel. Treiber used his model to predict the likely blockage caused in the various options. The model predicted that a mass start would risk overloading the riders if the bridge was used. Only by moving the starting point away from the bridge could the danger be avoided - and even then, if some of the numbers assumed in the model were only slightly inaccurate, there was still a risk of jams. at the bridge. On the other hand, no dangerous blockage seemed likely for the route of the tunnel. The race organizers consulted with the Treiber team and ultimately chose this option.",

Their study found that theobromine, found in cocoa, was almost a third more effective at stopping coughs than codeine, which was considered the best cough medicine today. Researchers at Imperial College London who published their results online said the discovery could lead to a more effective cough treatment. \" While coughing is not necessarily harmful, it can have a major effect on quality of life, and this finding could be a huge step forward in treating this problem, ”said Professor Peter Barnes. Ten healthy volunteers were given theobromine, codeine, or a placebo, a pill that did not contain any medication, during the experiment. Neither the volunteers nor the researchers knew who received which pill. The researchers then measured the levels of capsaicin, which is used in research to induce coughs and to show how well drugs stop coughing. The team found that when the volunteers were given theobromine, the capsaicin needed to produce a cough was about a third higher than in the placebo group. When they were given codeine, they only needed slightly higher capsaicin levers to induce a cough compared to the placebo. The researchers said theobromine works by reducing nerve activity, which causes coughing. They also found that unlike some standard cough treatments, theobromine did not cause any side effects such as drowsiness.",

        {
          "context": "A house of cards? Sounds amazing, doesn't it? Not if the architect is Bryan Berg, 31. He made a career of building fantastic card houses, stadiums, capitals, castles - and the tallest card tower in the world. How is it? Bryan's structures are amazing because they are made entirely of perfectly balanced, freestanding playing cards. He never uses glue, tape, or anything else to hold the cards together. He also doesn't fold cards. He discovered another way to create a strong house of cards, using a trick of nature. To make plants strong, nature builds them with strong-walled cells. The rows and rows of these cells form a grid that helps the leaves and stems maintain their shape. Bees use the same type of repeating pattern to create strong honeycombs, where they live and store honey. Bryan designs similar grids, using maps to create a repeating pattern of cells. It starts with a single cell made by balancing four cards against each other to form a box. Then it repeats the cell over and over again, extending outward to form the grid, which is a good basis for a solid board structure. The larger the grid, the more weight it can support. Sometimes Bryan uses multiple cards, instead of just one, to build the cell walls, which makes the grid even stronger. The trick, he tells kids when speaking in classrooms, is to place your cards as tightly as possible when laying out your grid, making sure the cards aren't tilted at all. After building this solid foundation, Bryan lays cards on top to make the ground for the building's next “story”. It can add towers, columns, bell towers or domes. Using the principle of cell repetition, Bryan builds structures of incredible strength. In the Unsurprisingly Cards, Bryan has always been interested in building things. Growing up on a \"big old farm\" in the Iowa countryside, he had plenty of room to play. \" We were in the middle of nowhere, ”recalls Bryan,“ with plenty of room to do whatever we wanted. I was always doing something, using things like sticks or hay bales. \" Bryan's grandfather taught him how to stack cards. Bryan's two interests - building and stacking cards - soon combined. But stacking on his family's farm was a challenge. \" Our old house had wood floors which weren't all level, ”he reports. And they weren't very firm. When people walked around it was like \"earthquake action\". It was a challenge to build something that wouldn't immediately fall. \" Bryan built round after round; he went through a lot of trial and error before he built something bigger than himself. When he placed a few decks of cards on top of his grid, he discovered how strong it was. Bryan's towers began to grow. How high is too high? Bryan's first Guinness World Record for the tallest card tower in the world came in the spring of 1992 when he was in high school. Learning that the world record was 12 feet 10 inches, Bryan built a slender tower that was taller than 14 feet 6 inches. Carried out as a project for his geometry class, it took him 40 hours and 208 decks of cards. It has since won world records for even taller buildings. Its latest winner was 25 feet 3.5 inches tall and used around 2,400 decks of cards. _ Why don't these towers fall? The key is in a good solid base, a repeating pattern of stories and a tapered top. Bryan likes to point out how the card buildings look like the real ones. They are built cell by cell, story by story. The separate parts form a solid whole. The heavier the building, the stronger and more stable it is. But not all of the weight can be on top. After spending so much time building something so cool, Bryan admits that it sometimes hurts to see his structures destroyed. But he compares his work to building a sandcastle or an ice sculpture.",

If we don't get enough of the vitamins we need from our diet, we run the risk of developing a number of diseases. What foods should we eat to keep us healthy? Let's take a look at some important vitamins. Vitamin A helps prevent the skin and other tissues from drying out. People who do not get enough vitamin A cannot see well in the dark. Vitamin A is found in fish liver oil and the yellow part of eggs. Vitamin B-1 is also called thiamine. Thiamine converts starches into energy. Thiamine is not only found in whole grains like brown rice, but also in beans and peas, nuts, meat, and fish. Vitamin B-12 is necessary for folic acid to do its job. Together they help make red blood cells. Folic acid has been shown to prevent physical problems in babies when taken by their mothers during pregnancy. Vitamin B-12 is found naturally in foods such as eggs, meat, fish, and dairy products. Vitamin B-12 is found in green leafy vegetables and other foods, such as legumes and citrus fruits. Vitamin C is necessary for strong bones and teeth. The body stores little vitamin C. We must therefore find it every day in foods such as citrus fruits, tomatoes and uncooked cabbage. Vitamin D prevents rickets from bone disease in children. Ultraviolet light from the sun converts a substance in the skin into vitamin D. Fish liver oil also contains vitamin D. Vitamin K is necessary for healthy blood. It thickens the blood around a cut to stop the bleeding. It is also found in pork products, liver, and in vegetables like cabbage, kale, and spinach.

Canadian teenager Justin Bieber, 16, has just had the magical experience: he uploaded homemade videos of his versions of songs by American singer Chris Brown for those close to him. He got a phone call from Brown, telling him how much he liked his performance. Her singing eventually won her a fan base and a recording deal. After releasing a popular record in November 2009, her album My world 2.0 was released last Tuesday. Bieber sings ballads and songs about the love of puppies. But is he just another gooey teen idol? Washington Post columnist David Malitz doesn't think so. \" If we really want what's best for American kids, let's stop and thank Justin Bieber, ”he wrote. After years of mundane bubblegum from Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers, the 16-year-old threw a candycoated wrench down the Disney assembly line giving young fans something worth screaming their lungs for. adorable pop songs. \" From a boy who grew up below the poverty line with his divorced mother to a star who caused nearriots in malls, even Bieber himself can't believe his fame overnight, although his gender success is becoming more and more common in the Internet age. Interested in hockey, Canada's national sport, the boy has already put pictures of players on the walls of his bedroom. He dreamed of being a hockey star and used to practice signing his autograph. He doesn't need practice now. He signs autographs, if the girls can get close enough, as a music star.",

Chanel No.5 This fragrance is probably the best-selling fragrance in the history of perfume. Created by Ernst Beaux for Coco Chanel in 1921, it has been described as \"the world's most legendary perfume\", and remains the company's most famous perfume. Shalimar Jacques Guerlain created this vanilla fragrance in 1925. The perfume takes its name from the Shalimar Garden, which was built by Emperor Shah Jehan for one of his wives. It was an immediate hit in 1925 and is still extremely popular today. Joy Joy is famous for having been the most expensive perfume in the world at one time. It was created in 1930 by Henri Almeras for Jean Patou in order to lift the bad mood that had swept the world after the stock market crash of 1929. L'Air du Temps Francis Farbon created L'Air du Temps by Nina Ricci in 1948. The perfume is known for its spicy scents of carnation and gardenia as well as for its beautiful crystal bottle (designed by Lalique). Eternity Calvin Klein's second fragrance was created by Sophia Grojsman in 1988. Known for its light and flowery scent, the fragrance was listed in the Fragrance Hall of Fame in 2003. It is recommended for daytime wear. Angel This very popular perfume was created in 1992 by Olivier Cresp for Thierry Mugler. The scent was an instant hit. The scent has often been called \"delicious\", due to its chocolatey scent. The perfume is presented in beautiful star-shaped bottles.

Well, to figure this out, you just need to look back at how you felt when you heard music in these places. Music is known to improve people's moods. Often times, music helps us pay attention to what we are doing. Music helps patients feel good and helps them recover faster and better. Depression is a state of mind that most of us experience at some point. There are times in our life when everything seems difficult. It seems like everything is getting worse and we have no control over our lives. Studies have shown that music can be an important part of the mood in such situations. Music also plays a big role in making us feel less nervous or worried. Anxiety can often lead to sleep loss and other illnesses. Music is often known as an international language. We may not know the language another person is speaking, but most of us react to music the same way. Music is often the best way to connect with someone. Music is one of the best ways to improve your mood, but a lot of it can depend on the type of music you're listening to. While happy music can definitely make you feel better, sad music can still lower your spirits. Listening to classical music can often make you feel a lot more powerful, while soft music can be the perfect way to unwind after a long road. If you want to use music to change the way you feel, you have to understand its role, learn to recognize the kind of music that puts you in a good mood and helps you feel better. Once you realize what kind of music you can use, you can use it to change how you feel. The right kind of music can be the perfect way to help us feel happier.",

          "context": "Smoking bans in public places are linked to falls in childhood asthma attacks and premature births, according to the largest analysis of the influence of public smoking bans on children's health. This finding should allay fears that such laws could have the opposite effect, as they could encourage people to smoke more at home. Several countries, such as Japan and Australia, have tightened laws on smoking in public places in recent years. Meanwhile, some countries, like the Netherlands and Germany, still allow smoking in pubs and restaurants. Only about half of US states have blanket bans, and there are few restrictions in poorer countries. Opponents often claim that the bans could cause people to smoke more at home, which would be worse for the health of their children. Asthma is one of the main concerns, as second-hand smoke damages children's airways in several ways. Researchers led by Jasper Been at Maastricht University Medical Center looked at up to 11 studies that looked at how hospital admissions for childhood asthma and premature births changed after the smoking ban. The studies included more than 2.5 million births and nearly 250,000 hospitalizations for asthma. The result shows that asthma admissions and preterm birth rates fell about 10 percent in one year after the smoking restrictions were applied. The effect on preterm births could also have been caused by pregnant women being more likely to stop or cut back after a public ban, Been says. But Been also says studies couldn't completely prove that smoking bans directly caused these changes. However, in fact, because the analysis included several smoking bans introduced in different countries in different years, and most saw improvements in health. These results are useful for countries and states where there is an ongoing debate about how strict the smoking ban should be, especially since hospital care for premature babies is so expensive. This is perhaps one of the most important things to know when it comes to strengthening legislation. Other studies have shown that heart attack and stroke rates also tend to drop after the introduction of smoking bans.",

The law, due to be passed this month, is likely to spark a revolution in family affairs in a country where 40% of men are said to do no housework at all. It will force men to \"share domestic responsibilities and the care and attention\" of children and elderly family members, according to the draft approved by the Spanish parliament's justice committee. \" It will be a good way to remind people of their homework. This is something feminists have wanted for a long time, ”said Margarita Uria, of the Basque Nationalist Party, which was behind what is an amendment to a new divorce law. The non-respect of the obligations will be taken into consideration by the judges when determining the conditions of divorce. Men who refuse to do their part may have less frequent contact with their children. Spanish women spend five times more time on household chores than husbands. Even when both have jobs outside the home, Spanish women still do three times as much home work. \" It's not just about housework, ”Uria said. A study conducted five years ago by the Spanish Center for Sociological Investigation found that fathers spent an average of 13 minutes a day caring for their children. Only 19% of Spanish men think it's fair that mothers of school-aged children have a full-time job. More than a third thought mothers should not work outside the home at all. The change in the Spanish legal code will see national obligations added to a list of matrimonial duties that currently includes fidelity, living together and mutual aid. This should ensure that when the law - which will also make divorce proceedings faster and easier - is passed in parliament in the coming weeks, the obligation to share household chores will be added to the statutes.",

My train was running a little late, but it wasn't a big deal - I could text him to tell him I would be delayed. He would understand. But ... where was my cell phone? I had that familiar shipwreck feeling. Yes, I forgot it at home. No cell phone. I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels anxious, _ and worried when I don't have my phone with me. In fact, I know I'm not alone: two-thirds of us experience “nomophobia”, the fear of losing cell phone contact. That's according to a 2012 study that asked 1,000 people in the UK about their relationship with cell phones. He says we check our cell phones 34 times a day, that women are more `` nomophobic '' than men, and that 18-24 year olds are most likely to fear being without their cell phone: 77% d 'of them say they are unable to be separated from their phone for more than a few minutes. Do you suffer from nomophobia? * You never turn your phone off * You obsessively check for text messages, missed calls and emails * You always take your phone with you to the bathroom * You never let the battery run out This is funny to think that about 20 years ago the only people with cell phones would be businessmen carrying their big plastic \"bricks\". Of course, these days cell phones are everywhere. A UN study done this year said mobile phone subscriptions would outnumber people in the world by the end of 2014. And when there are more phones than people in the world, maybe it's time to ask who's really in charge? Are you controlling your phone or is your phone controlling you? So what happened with my college friend? When I arrived a few minutes late he just laughed and said, \"You haven't changed at all - always always late!\" And we had a great afternoon catching up, full of jokes and stories, with no interruptions and no nagging urges to check my phone. Not having him with me was oddly liberating. Maybe I'll leave it at home on purpose next time.",

Jazz was invented in the city a few years before its birth. Armstrong often said, \"Jazz and I grew up together.\" Armstrong showed a great talent for music when he was taught to play the cornet in a boy. In his late teens, Armstrong began living the life of a musician. He performed in parades, clubs, and on the steamboats that traveled the Mississippi River. At that time, New Orleans was famous for new jazz music and was home to many great musicians. Armstrong learned from older musicians and quickly became respected as their equal. In 1922 he went to Chicago. There begins the story of Louis Armstrong. From then until the end of his life Armstrong was celebrated and loved wherever he went. Armstrong had no equal when it came to playing popular American song.

That's the challenge for users of a new virtual reality program called SurviVR, designed to train employees to handle an active shooting situation in the workplace. The program works with HTC Vive, the virtual reality headset released earlier this year. An active fire situation occurs when one or more armed persons actively fire in a small populated area with the intent to kill. There were 20 such situations in the United States last year and 20 the year before, according to FBI statistics, resulting in a total of 231 deaths. This year saw the deadliest active shooting situation in US history, with 49 people killed at a nightclub in Orlando. In the training situation, users have four choices. They can lock themselves in the office. They can hide, maybe in the office cupboard. They can run for an outing. Or they can use something in the office - a computer or a mug, a pair of scissors - as a weapon to fight the shooter. This is an improvement over the standard training for active shooters. Gallo says, who usually teaches people to lock themselves in and hide. The \"lock-in\" method is often ineffective, he says, and has resulted in many deaths in recent years. At the basic level of training, no one is killed. But as practices get more advanced, players who make the wrong choice get shot. There is no blood; the screen simply turns black slowly. If that sounds terrifying, that's the point, Gallo says. There are many training programs available to teach employees how to deal with workplace violence, sometimes involving role play with toy guns. But these formations are essentially games. Gallo says, with relaxed and even having fun. To teach people what they really need to know in an active shooting situation, they need to be afraid. \" SurviVR will take fear and transform it into confidence. \" Said Gallo.",

What do you know about the Scandinavian country? Denmark is famous for its design culture. At the heart of \"Danish Design\" is the idea that, as poet and designer Piet Hein puts it: \"There is an art, no more and no less, [and that is] doing everything with naivety.\" Danish design emphasizes both practicality and quality. From Lego toys to furniture, Danish products are known for their clean lines, simplicity and functionality. \" Remove hardware where it is not needed. Keep things simple and functional and do them with care, \"explained Hans J. Wegner, the first Danish designer to achieve worldwide fame:\" The goal is not to create a work of art, but to produce a good chair. \"\" The Danes have done a better job than most in promoting the arts in Europe, given the size and population of their country, in the areas of architecture, sculpture and design, ”writes Helena Smith , reporter for the British newspaper The Guardian. The simplicity of Danish design can extend to the quality of life there. Some even claim that the Danes have the best quality of life of any country in the world. Kate Vial, a 55-year-old American who has lived and worked in Denmark for over 30 years, explaining why she chooses to live in Denmark over the United States, told Germany's largest news weekly Der Spiegel: \" I just chose a simpler way of life where I could ride my bike anywhere and don't have to make a living to survive. \"",

I'm really tired, but my first day at school went well and I feel a lot better now. First of all, we had to meet outside the school building. I was very nervous because my elementary school only had 300 students, but in secondary school there are about 1,300. What a difference! The older students are really tall. I felt so small waiting there in front of the school. The other problem was that I didn't know anyone. My family moved over the summer vacation because of daddy's new job. So now I have to try to make new friends. Standing in front of the school this morning, I wanted to be back to my old school with my old friends. The principal came out and told us to go to the school hall. Then he called out our names to tell us what class we were in. My class teacher is called Mrs. Black. She took us to our classroom. It's on the 5th floor and ... guess what? ... We are not allowed to use the elevator. I couldn't believe it. When we were all up the stairs, I started talking to another boy who didn't know anyone. He said his family moved from Hong Kong over the summer. He looked really sweet so we sat together when we got to our classroom, breathless! He said his English was very poor but I thought it was really good. We spent the whole morning with Mrs. Black looking at our schedules. Everyone at school has a different schedule - can you believe it? Half of the school learns Spanish as a second language and the other half learns French. I'm part of the Spanish group, which sounds like fun. I'm afraid I'll forget my schedule and go to the wrong room! How will someone help me if no one else has the same schedule as me? Lunch time was ok. After lunch, we started the lessons. I had math, which was complicated and difficult, and then history, where we started learning ancient Greece. That looks interesting. I have to do some homework tonight to find out how the ancient Greeks lived. So far, so good. I can't wait for tomorrow, even though I have some science. I hate science! Jason",

Popular wisdom has it that parents' relationships can suffer once their youngsters fly into the co-op because they feel they have lost their purpose in life. However, a new study by researchers at the University of California at Berkeley found that many couples feel happier when their children leave home because they are able to spend time together. A total of 123 American mothers born in the 1930s were followed for 18 years and asked to rate their level of satisfaction soon after their marriage, when they were raising babies, once their children had reached their age. adolescence and finally at 61, when almost all had \"empty nests\". While not all said they were happier in general, most said their marriages have improved since their children left home. Researchers believe this wasn't just because the spouses spent more time together, but because they were able to enjoy each other's company more. One of the study participants, which is published in the journal Psychological Science, said: \"Once the kids get older ... some of that stress is removed ... that responsibility is removed, so the kids get older. things are a little more relaxed. \" Psychologist Sara Gorchoff, who led the investigation, said: \"The take-home message for couples with young children is 'hang in there'.\" Its co-author Oliver John added, \"Don't wait until your kids leave home to plan some quality time with your partner.\" However, Dr Dorothy Rowe of the British Psychological Society said the effects of living in an \"empty nest\" will depend on the parents' relationship with their children. “If you just wait for them to leave home so that you can move on with your life, then of course you'll be glad to see them go,” she said, “But if you've built your life around your children you will be. terribly alone.

What is a hybrid car? Any car that uses two or more energy sources is a hybrid car. Most of the hybrid cars on the road today are gasoline-electric hybrids. The gasoline-electric hybrid car is exactly what it looks like - a cross between a gasoline-powered car and an electric car. A gasoline-powered car has a fuel tank, which supplies gasoline to the engine. An electric car, on the other hand, has a set of batteries that provide electricity to the car. To be of use to you or me, a car must be able to travel at least 300 miles (483 km) before refueling, be able to be refueled quickly and easily, and quickly enough to keep up with the rest of the traffic on the road. road. A gasoline-powered car meets these requirements but produces a large amount of pollution. An electric car, however, produces almost no pollution, but can only travel 80 to 161 km between charges. And the problem is, the electric car is very slow and inconvenient to charge. A gasoline-powered and electric car combines the advantages of both energy sources into a single system that uses both gas and electric power. Some experts believe that the hybrid car is \"the next generation of smart cars\". A hybrid car can go up to 50% further than a traditional car with the same amount of gasoline! It saves the driver's money on gasoline and reduces air pollution!",

Readers of How Do Animals Adapt? These adaptations are well explained in double pages with examples clearly represented in photographs and diagrams and developed through the accompanying captions. As the title suggests, movement is at the center of Comment bougent les Animaux? Beginning with a description of the explanation of movement, the reader is exposed to the many different ways animals move in air, on land, under land, and in water. Several unconventional variations (eg, thumbworm curl, snake rectilinear motion) are included. Once again, the photographs and diagrams clearly support the double-page discussions of animal movement. The language of both titles is simple enough for young readers without speaking to them. In both books, terminology is presented in. Some of these words are explained in the basic glossary while most are explained clearly in the text. Many of these terms provide readers with fascinating and unusual words (eg brachiation, potassium, skein, and guess).

I felt like something really important had been said to me, but it took many years before it got in. Back then, going to college was a rare privilege. My dad told me that if I had chosen something to study that I enjoyed doing, I would always look forward to my job. But he also added that even having a job you hate is better than not having a job at all. I wanted to be a farmer, but I joined a military program to help pay for my college education. And what started out as an obligation to the military became a way of life that I had devoted myself to for 37 years.

He told me that a machine would put this lady out of work. And as bad as this woman's job was, it was enough to keep a small family alive. It reminded me of my father's words: to work is a blessing. After seeing many people like this woman in Bangladesh, I came to believe that unemployed people are not free. They are victims of crime, ill health and depression.

Many people who live in the hundreds live in the Mediterranean, so their diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts and healthy fats like olive oil, is getting a lot of attention. Diet has been linked to a healthy older age, a lower risk of heart disease, and even protection against memory loss. Education is linked to a longer life. A 2012 report from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics found that people with a bachelor's degree or higher live about nine years longer than people who do not complete high school. James Smith, health economist at RAND Corporation, also supports the argument for staying in school for better life expectancy. His results show that education should be an even more important factor than race and income. Educated people are more likely to get better jobs, plan for their future, and make healthier lifestyle choices. Being a hard worker doesn't necessarily mean that stress at work will hurt you. The longevity study found that many hard workers lived long lives. \" Skeptics may wonder if hard workers really appreciate life. \" the authors write: \"We have found that productive and hardworking people (even older) are not stressed or miserable, but tend to be happier, healthier and more socially connected than their less productive peers.\" Having a strong social group is associated with a longer life. We often look to our friends and family for support, and taking care of the people who matter to us can help us take better care of ourselves, some data shows. Some research even suggests that immune function is improved when we are with our friends and they help manage stress. Research shows that sitting for a long time puts people at risk of shorter lifespan and other health risks. A 2011 study found that every hour people spent sitting and watching TV after age 25 was linked to 22 minutes of their overall life expectancy.",

          "context": "What is the main testing ground for fears about the incomplete or inadequate rearing of children? The college admission process. If you're worried about not disciplining your kids enough, the proof of parenting failure is right there in front of everyone. The child does not complete his university applications! If you are worried that you allowed your children to watch too much TV and settle for bad grades, you will have to answer for the consequences. The over-involvement of many parents in the process is, in my view, a blanket for this deep parental anxiety: Did I do a good job with this child? Did I do everything I needed for this child? Is this child going to have a good life? I have seen many parents dive back into their children's lives upon admission to college, trying to put all of their wisdom and discipline into their children at the last moment. Parents may need to make sure that their children leave the nest that they have really been taught to fly. Since it is impossible to assess the quality of what parents have done for their children at this point, the next best thing is the status of the roommate in which the child is admitted. From the perspective of an anxious parent, an “Ivy l, eague college” child is proof of a better child rearing than a “small college”. I once sat down with a talented and weak senior daughter and her brilliant parents. She and them and the school had to decide whether to return to school or go to the hospital. In light of her anorexia (), the school strongly recommended that she not make her first application to Princeton. Hearing this, the girl looked at the adults in the room and said, \"If I can't apply to Princeton early, I'll die.\" Her parents were also eager to bring her into Princeton. Why did they all desperately need it? Because, in this case, something was wrong with the family. Due to a certain weakness in his upbringing, this child was neither happy nor sure of himself. Yet, she was eighteen, the culture forced her to leave home. The psychological solution for all of them was the heartwarming sight of a great college. One way or another, going there would make his life easier and defend the education of his parents' children. Such fears of letting an unchecked child go exist in all families. How can we abandon a child who is still so young in many ways? It is painful and has only time and hope to cure it. For parents looking for a pain reliever, the college admissions process is where they can resolve their anxieties.",

My wife and I wanted to give James the best education, but that meant we had to change jobs and spend less time with our child. I asked myself, \"Would this compromise be worth it?\" When I look at research on child development, I think it might not be. Where our kids go to school matters less than most American parents realize. Social scientists have long been trying to determine why some children grow up to be successful. In a 2001 study, Greg Duncan, professor of education at the University of California, measured the influence that people in a child's life have on how the child does in school. Duncan and his team found virtually no relationship between how the students passed the test and the people they sat next to in class, who they hung out with after school, and who lived in their neighborhood. The only significant connection they found was between siblings and twins in particular. For a long time, academics believed that a family's income strongly affects children's performance in life. But it may not be. When Susan Mayer of the University of Chicago looked at the relationship between family income and lifelong success, she conducted a series of experiments to measure it, finding that these results were not caused by Income. She argued that the things that make a difference are relatively inexpensive: the number of books a child owns or how often their family goes to museums. Lareau, another researcher began one of the most in-depth observations of American parenthood. He concluded that success is much more about the time parents spend with their children. He said: “Many parents I interviewed are worried about the future of their children. But they have exaggerated the sense of the risks involved if they do not give their children \"the best\" of everything. \" So, finally, we decided to leave it as it is. More time with our child is the best we can offer.",

At the start of the year, students each received a _, ranging from \"excellent prospect\" to \"unlikely to do well\". These assessments were totally false and did not reflect the students' past performance. However, these marks were given to the teachers. At the end of the year, the experimenters compared the performance of the students with the grades. Despite their actual abilities, there was a surprisingly high link between performance and grades. It seems people are performing as well as we would expect. The self-fulfilling effect is also known as the Pygmalion effect. It comes from an old Greek story. History was also the basis of the play \"Pygmalion\" by George Bernard Shaw, later transformed into the musical \"My Fair Lady\". In Shaw's play, Professor Henry Higgins claims he can turn Cockney florist, Eliza Doolittle, into a Duchess. But, as Eliza herself points out to Higgins' friend Pickering, it's not what she learns or does that determines whether she will become a Duchess, but how she will be treated. The implication of the Pygmalion effect for leaders and managers is massive. This means that the performance of your team depends less on them than on you. The performance you get from people is neither better nor worse than you expect, which means you should always expect the best. As Goethe said, “Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is. Treat a man as he can and should be and he will become what he can and should be. \"",

Isn't it worth holding back, playing cool, and waiting for the other half to show their hand faster? \" A great relationship should be fair and equal, ”says psychologist Sidney Crown. But love is rarely equal. \"\" All relationships go through power struggles, but \"he says,\" if a love imbalance persists for years, rot will set in. \" This feeling of \"I've always loved you more\" can be subverted (,) for a while, but it never goes away completely, and it often emerges from quarrels. In love, at least, the silent and restrained type is not always the most powerful. \" The strongest person in a relationship is often the person who feels confident enough to talk about their feelings, ”explains educational psychologist Ingrid Collins. Psychosexual therapist Paula Hall agrees. \" The one who has the upper hand is often the one who takes the initiative. \" In fact, the person who says \"I love you\" first can also be the person who says \"I miss you first\". Hall believes that a lot depends on how \"I love you\" and the motivation of the person saying it. Does it say when they are drunk? Is it said before their partner takes off on vacation, and what it really means is \"Please don't cheat on me\"? When they say \"I love you\" they are really saying \"Do you love me?\" If so, wouldn't it be more honest to say so. Collins agrees that intention is everything. \" It is not what is said, but how it is said. It comes down to the sincerity of the speaker. \"",

If you miss this opportunity, it is almost impossible for you to do so later in life. * To gain intercultural experience Living abroad makes you see your everyday world in a whole new light. You don't even realize it, but our culture shapes the way we see the world and affects us every minute of the day. Differences in culture are more than just differences in language, food, clothing, and art. * To improve your communication skills and your self-confidence People who study abroad tend to be willing to take risks, put themselves in unusual situations and solve problems. * To better master a language or to learn a new language The global market is shrinking and many companies are demanding a second language. Foreign languages are not only valuable in the job market, but also valuable in the real world. * For adventure Travel to other cities in your host country and to neighboring countries. By getting to know your new classmates, roommates and host family, you will gain a unique view of the host culture. Discover the differences and, most importantly, the many similarities between your worlds. The friendships you make will last long after the program. * Find out more about yourself Find out who you really are. What are your limits? How do you overcome challenges that you never have _ before? How independent are you? These questions are difficult to answer until you are removed from your usual surroundings. After solving difficult problems abroad on your own, you will find that almost nothing will confuse you at home.

The London 2012 Organizing Committee (Locog) confirmed on Wednesday that an error in its ticket sales led to an oversold of 10,000 tickets for four synchronized swimming competitions. Locog and its ticket agent spent the Christmas season contacting ticket holders and offering them alternatives that included the tickets they had applied for but to no avail. The suspensions do not require any additional cost. He also offered to return any discrepancies if the new tickets cost less than the originals. Locog said the replacement tickets would come from a number of seats that were unsold during the Olympics and were doing everything they could to make up for the error of fans buying tickets. Locog said the error occurred during the summer, between the first and second round of ticket sales, when a staff member made a mistake entering \"20,000\" into the computer rather than the correct figure of 10,000 remaining tickets. The error was discovered when Locog checked the number of tickets sold against the final seat numbers and started contacting ticket holders before Christmas. Thousands of ticket holders have already gotten lucky, switching to tickets to major events such as the swim and track finals, and in about 200 cases, the hottest of all, the men's 100m final. . Locog said the decision to award tickets for the 100m final was made because one of the synchronized swimming competitions was taking place on the same afternoon as the event, on August 5.",

Psychology professor Craig Kinsley believes his findings will translate into humans. “Our research shows that pregnancy hormones protect the brain, including estrogen, which we know has many neuroprotective effects,” Kinsley said. \" This is data on rats, but humans are mammals, just as these animals are mammals, ”he added in a telephone interview. \"They go through pregnancy and hormonal changes.\" Kinsley said he hopes public health officials and researchers will look to see if having children protects a woman from Alzheimer's disease and other forms of brain decline linked to the age. \" When people think of pregnancy, they think of what happens to babies and the mother from the neck down, \"said Kinsley, who presented her findings at the Society of Neuroscience annual meeting in Orlando, Fla. . \" They don't realize that hormones are washing the brain. If you look at females who have never been pregnant, they act differently towards the young. But if she goes through pregnancy, she will sacrifice her life for her baby - it's a big change in her behavior that's manifested in genetic alterations in the brain. \"",

          "context": "Five or six years ago I attended a conference on the science of attention. A professor who conducts research in medical school spoke about attention blindness, the fundamental characteristic of the human brain that when we focus on one task causes us to miss just about everything else. Because we can't see what we can't see, our speaker was determined to catch us in the act. He made us watch a video of six people throwing basketballs back and forth, three in white shirts and three in black, and our task was to follow only the throws among the people in white. The ribbon rolled up and everyone started counting. Everyone, except me. I'm dyslexic, and the moment I saw this tape with the confusing basketball pitchers, I knew I couldn't keep up with their movements, so I let my mind wander. I became curious, however, when about 30 seconds after the start of the tape, a gorilla entered among the players. She (we later learned that a student was in a gorilla costume) looked at the camera, punched her chest with her fist, then left as they continued to pass the bullets. When the tape stopped, the professor asked how many people had counted at least a dozen basketball throws. Hands went up everywhere. He then asked who had counted 13, 14 and congratulated those who got the perfect 15. Then he asked: \"And who saw the gorilla?\" I raised my hand and was surprised to find that I was the only person at my table and one of the three or four in the great room doing so. He had put us in place, trapping us in our own attention blindness. Yes, there had been a trick, but he wasn't the one who played it on us. By focusing so hard on the count, we had managed to miss the gorilla in the middle. Attention blindness is the fundamental organizing principle of the brain, and I believe it offers us a great opportunity. My point of view is different from that of many neuroscientists: where they see the shortcomings of the individual, I sense an opportunity for cooperation. Fortunately, given the interactive nature of most of our lives in the digital age, we have the tools to control and take advantage of our various forms of attention. It's not easy to admit that everything we've learned about how to pay attention means we've missed everything else. It is not easy for us logical, intelligent and confident types to admit that the very key to our success - our ability to discover a problem and solve it, a success achieved during all these years in the business. school and beyond - maybe exactly what limits us. No one has ever told us that our way of seeing leaves everything else aside.",

On the phone, his mother told him: “Mr. Belser died last night, the funeral is on Wednesday. “Memories flashed through his mind like old news as he sat quietly remembering his childhood days. When Jack was very young, his father died. Mr. Belser, who lived in the same neighborhood with them, spent as much time as possible to make sure that Jack had the influence of a man in his life. He spent a lot of time teaching Jack that he was thinking about what was important in his next life. If Mr. Belser hadn't taught him how to weave, he wouldn't be in this trade by now. He therefore promised his mother to attend Mr. Belser's funeral. \" You better not drive your car. It is a long road. \"his mother warned him. Busy as he was, he kept his word. Although tired from the first flight, Jack did his best to help. Mr Belser's funeral was minimal because he had no children and most of his children were deceased. The day before he was due home, Jack and his mother stopped by to see the old house Mr. Belser once lived in. Now it was up to him. He bought the house from one of his s. The house was exactly as he remembered it. Each step kept memories. Every picture, every piece of furniture ... Jadk stopped abruptly. The box on his desk was gone! He once asked the old man what was inside. He just smiled and said it was the most precious thing for him, even though it cost others next to nothing. He thought someone from the Belser family had taken it. “I'll never know what was so precious to him. Jack thought disappointedly. Three days later, back home from work, Jack found a small package in his mailbox. The writing was difficult to read, but the return address caught his attention. \"Mr. Harold Belser \"he said. Jack couldn't wait to open it. Inside was the familiar little box. His heart pounding, Jack opened the box. Inside he found a gold pocket watch with these words engraved: \"Jack, thank you for your time! Harold Belser.\" \" What he appreciated the most was my time. “Jack held the watch to his chest, tears filling his eyes.",

With inferior lenses and image sensors, smartphones are unlikely to replace professional video cameras anytime soon. Yet some creative filmmakers are expanding the frontiers of smartphone movie making by shooting professional-quality movies using only smartphones. Shortly after the release of Apple's iPhone 4, two filmmakers decided to make a short film using only their iPhone 4s. Michael Koerbel and Anna Elizabeth James shot and edited the 1.5-minute film Apple of My Eye in just 48 hours. Audiences were mesmerized by the film, in which a man and his grandfather emotionally connect while admiring a model train set in a display case. The filmmakers continued their success with Goldilocks, an extraordinary spy novel told in nine three-minute films. Many filmmakers believe smartphone movies are here to stay. One sign is their inclusion in major film festivals. In February 2012, the organizers of the Berkshire International Film Festival hosted the 10 X 10 On North Festival. Entries included Oliver from Hooman Khalili, an award-winning film about a girl whose special powers allow her to brighten the lives of three lonely people. Another entry was Yearlapse'11, a 365-second film by Zsolt Haraszti that describes an actual trip he made from New York to London. During the festival, which ran from February 16-26, these films and more were screened at the Beacon Cinema in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Similar festivals in Canada and South Korea have given smartphone filmmakers the chance to show off their creative work.",

Queensland Rail CEO Paul Scurrah said rising waterways have closed some train lines and road closures and property damage across the southeast have contributed to a shortage of available rail workers. \" We intend to run trains hourly on all lines, similar to the schedules we operate on Christmas Day. We will also seek to provide other additional services to meet demand as required. At this point we will arrange services stopping at all stations that will depart at the same time on time, however, this is all subject to weather conditions and the availability of on-board personnel. \" Mr Scurrah encouraged all customers to visit Translink's website for specific departure times from their station and asked for patience with any delays. \" Queensland Rail recognizes that cutting services can cause disruption, but it is simply inevitable. We have a dedicated and experienced team monitoring the situation 24 hours a day and we will work to reopen the network as soon as possible, ”said Scurrah.

It is argued that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device, the BRICs, should really be the BICs. \" Is Russia Really Worth the Name of BRIC? \" asks Anders Aslund, senior researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreign Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of \"The Russian Balance Sheet,\" believes Putin and Medvedev's Russia is just not worthy of inclusion alongside Brazil, India and the United States. China in the list of future economic powers. He writes: “The country's economic performance has fallen to such a low level that one has to wonder if it has anything to say about the global economy, compared to other members of its group. I just got back from Moscow, which is still lackluster this season. In the past seven years, Russia has taken very little action to improve its economy. Instead, the state lived off oil and gas. \" Economically, Aslund has the numbers on her side. The International Monetary Fund estimates that the Russian economy will fall 6.7% in 2009, while China will grow 8.5% and India 5.4%. There are fewer cases for Brazil, with a drop of 0.7%, but it still does much better than Russia. But the BRICs are not just about the economy. As mentioned above, this is a marketing device to encourage investors to focus on the big, promising players. From an investment perspective, one could argue that Russia leads the BRICs. Its stock market is up 128% this year, while about 80% is for the other three. At least despite Russia's economic underperformance, its market outperformance suggests that it is indeed part of the group.",

But experts are now warning that the current shoe fad will cause discomfort in teens in the short term and store years of foot, knee and back pain in the future. Here, the experts identify the problems caused by the choice of shoes for teenagers. The KEDS / VANS Slip-on shoes with elastic sides are particularly popular with teenagers - with Keds and Vans the most sought-after brands. The main problem is that they are just too flat - so flat that the heel, which hits the ground first, also becomes damaged and painful. BALLET PUMPS The worst shoes of all are light and thin dolly shoes. Part of the problem is their flatness, as with Keds and Vans. However, ballerinas, which do not have a string or heel, have other specific problems. \" As the shoe does not have a fastener, it relies on the toes to hold the shoe, causing an uncomfortable gait, which leads to short and long term issues such as calluses, heel pain and knee. \" WEDGES AND STILETTOS These shoes can also cause gait problems. They may look beautiful, but heels are so high that they can push the wearer's body weight forward, making them very unstable. Teens who wear these shoes regularly are also at risk of joining the millions of women with constant back pain. SCHOOL SHOES So what do podiatrists have on their wish list, especially for everyday use? Something in a natural, breathable fabric, with a string to hold it in, with a small heel and a deep toe that doesn't press on the toes, like Clark's, Marks & Spencer or Rhino. If your teen insists on wearing the “wrong” shoes, get him simple foot orthotics in the shoes. These support and correct the movement of the foot and, properly adjusted by a podiatrist, can often transform their walk and stop the damage.",

Internet learning is a new style that seems to be successful compared to traditional teaching. The Internet provides schools with a large amount of educational material accessible to students online. With the choice of online courses, completing a program becomes much easier. We went to the library when we needed information and spent hours researching the right sources. Today there is a \"library\" in our house and it is available 24 hours a day. From my personal experience, being a first-time mom, I find using online information to be very helpful. While I am at home with my baby, I can always search for the materials I need and exchange thoughts and information with my classmates without leaving my home. The Internet is not only a great provider of information, but also a saver of time and money. People predict that education will be much cheaper in the future because of Internet access to information. The cost of land, buildings and teachers' salaries continues to rise. In addition, regular (offline) courses rely heavily on books and other paper media, while online education publishes lectures and homework electronically, saving thousands of dollars each year. Without any physical restrictions, classes and courses on the Internet are also very convenient. In classroom education, the number of students is limited while Internet education is accessible to all. Students don't have to struggle to get into the classes they love.

I write for a large journal and wanted to write a story about parachute jumping. To make it a realistic yet compelling story, I decided I needed to take a leap myself first. Unfortunately, I'm not good at any sport of any kind, let alone parachute jumping. My friend Mr. Smith was ready to give me a hand. He took me to a ground school. The first day's training included several hours of instruction but not my first descent from the plane. For that, I had to wait until the next morning. The next morning, after a rushed and anxious breakfast, I was driven to the airfield. There, two heavy parachutes were put on my back. Then I was asked to head for a small plane that had come to a slow stop on the runway. Once on the plane, it was soon climbing. I started to feel nervous. As we reached a thousand yards, Harry, my teacher, hooked a line from my parachute to a steel ring inside the plane. The rope had to open my parachute after I jumped. \" Prepare yourself, Henry, ”said Harry. I walked cautiously to the door. I wanted to cry: \"No, no, no!\" but no word came. \" Jump!\" Harry called out loud. \" Jump!\" To my surprise, hitting like a frog, I jumped. Far from the plane, and down, I fell. It worked! The air seemed to hold me back. I was very happy. Then I felt a rapid surge. My big parachute had opened! It was like the best surprise I have ever had. I looked down. There were rivers, trees, fields and houses. I heard the soft sound of the air. It was fun!",

          "context": "In a few states where racial prejudice is serious, violence has come to be seen so much as a means of resolving disputes that it is not even questioned. There are states where the white man imposes his domination by force; there are states where the black man protests by burning down towns and looting and plundering. Important figures on both sides, who in other respects would seem reasonable men, stand up and calmly plead for violence - as if it were a legitimate solution, like any other. What's really scary, what really fills you with despair, is the realization that when it comes to the crisis, we haven't made any real progress. We can wear necklaces and ties instead of war paint, but our instincts remain basically unchanged. The entire recorded history of the human race, this tedious documentation of violence, has taught us absolutely nothing. We still haven't learned that violence never solves a problem but makes it worse. The sheer horror, the bloodshed, the suffering mean nothing. No solution ever comes to light the next day, when we mournfully gaze at the smoldering ruins and wonder what struck us. Truly reasonable men who know where the solutions lie find it increasingly difficult to be heard. They are despised, mistrusted and even persecuted by their own kind because they advocate seemingly outrageous things like law enforcement. If half the energy devoted to acts of violence was put to good use, if our efforts had been directed towards cleaning up shabby homes to improve living standards and provide education and employment for all, we would have made a difference. long way to achieve a Solution. Our strength is weakened by having to clean up the mess that violence leaves in its wake. In a well-directed effort, it would not be impossible to realize the ideals of a stable social program. The benefits that can be derived from constructive solutions are visible all over the world around us. Genuine and lasting solutions are always possible, as long as we work within the framework of the law. Before we can even begin to think about peaceful coexistence between races, we must appreciate each other's problems. And to do this, you have to learn about them: it is a simple exercise in communication, exchanging information. \" Talk, talk, talk, \"say the advocates of violence,\" all you do is talk, and we're no wiser. It's a bit like the story of the famous lawyer who carefully explained his case to the judge. After listening to a long discussion, the judge complained that after all this speech he was not wiser. \" Possible, my lord, replied the lawyer, no wiser, but surely much better informed. Knowledge is the necessary precondition for wisdom: the knowledge that violence creates the evils it claims to solve.",

This is why doctors, dentists and nurses usually wear white uniforms. Babies are dressed in white at christenings and brides wear white wedding dresses at weddings. White in these cases is the symbol of innocence or purity. Sometimes white is used in expressions that are not good. \" Whitewash \"is one such phrase. At first, \"brushing\" meant painting something with white paint to make it look better. However, that means something different today: hiding or covering up mistakes or failures. A \"white elephant\" is another example of white used in a negative way. In ancient Thailand, a white elephant was considered a sacred animal, but it was very expensive to breed it. The kings of the time presented a white elephant to the people they wanted to ruin. Once they received this holy and royal animal as a gift, they were not allowed to sell or kill it. Today a \"white elephant\" means something that is big, unnecessary, and unwanted. In America, when people want to get rid of their furniture or clothes, they often organize a “white elephant sale”.",

What's in the name? Sometimes the problem is the name. When General Motors introduced its Chevy Nova to Latin America, it overlooked the fact that Nova in Spanish means 'it's not right'. Sure enough, the Chevy Nova has never been anywhere in Latin America. Translation Problems Sometimes it's the slogan that doesn't work. No company knows this better than Pepsi-Cola, with its \"Come alive with Pepsi!\" countryside. The campaign was so successful in the United States that Pepsi literally translated its slogan for its international campaign. It turned out that the translations were not quite correct. Pepsi begged the Germans to 'come out of the grave' and told the Chinese that 'Pepsi is bringing your ancestors back from the grave'. A picture is worth a thousand words Other times the problem is with the packaging. A photo of a smiling baby has helped sell countless jars of Gerber baby food. When Gerber first started selling baby food in Africa, they used the same packaging as in the United States, with the smiling baby on the label. Later they learned that in African countries the picture on the jar shows what the jar contains, because many people cannot read. Twist of destiny Even culture and religious factors and pure coincidence can be involved. Thorn McAn shoes have a Thorn McAn \"signature\" on the inside. To the people of Bangladesh, which is a Muslim country, this signature resembled an Arabic script for the word Allah.

Sensor size Along with the megapixel count,the size of the sensor dictates the general image quality as well as the camera's performance in low light. It also determines whether the camera can electronically put the details it captures bigger enough to see--which is what makes the pictures not clear enough to see when you view the photos on a bigger screen. Portability \"The important thing is that the camera isn't too big or heavy,and that you have a good zoom range for both wide-angle and telephoto shots ,\"Atherton told CNN.A good choice would be a slim,light pocket camera with a high-qualified built-in optical zoom. \"These are very popular for travel as they are light,but built with a telephoto lens that can zoom up to 60 times,\" Atherton said. Zoom and shutter speed For action or crowd shots,a fast shutter speed is a key factor. \"When dealing with anything that's active--wildlife or people in action on the street--faces change within a tiny part of a second,\" said Arnold,\"a fast shutter speed is helpful in shooting the several hundred photos you might need to get that single winning shot.\"",

His answer was that he could not carry the books a few meters because it was not his job. However, I remembered myself helping people for so many years carrying boxes, shopping bags, or pushing wheelchairs upon the request of a stranger in need or when my conscience called on me. \"Oh, this young generation, they have no manners, \"my grandmother would say.

And researchers have suggested that dogs' origins can date back to Europe, the Near East, Siberia and South China. Central Asia is the newest and best candidate, according to a large study of dogs from around the world. Laura M. Shannon and Adam R. Boyko at Cornell University, and an international group of other scientists, studied not only purebred dogs, but also street or village dogs. Dr. Shannon analyzed three different kinds of DNA, Dr. Boyko said, the first time this has been done for such a large and diverse group of dogs from 38 countries. And that led them to Central Asia as the place of origin for dogs in much the same way that genetic studies have located the origin of modern humans in East Africa. The analysis, Dr. Boyko said, pointed to Central Asia, as the place where \"all the dogs alive today\" come from. The data did not allow precise dating of the origin, he said, but showed it occurred at least 15,000 years ago. Greger Larson of Oxford University, who is leading a large international effort to analyze ancient DNA from fossilized bones, said he was impressed by the study. \"It's really great to see not just the number of street dogs, but also the geographic breadth and the number of remote locations where the dogs were sampled,\" he said in an email. He also praised the sampling of different kinds of DNA and the analytic methods. Dr. Larson, who was not involved with the study, said he thought the Central Asia finding required further testing. He said he suspected that the origins of modern dogs were \"extremely messy\" and that no amount of sampling of living populations will be definitive. He said a combination of studies of modern and ancient DNA is necessary.",

One meaning is that a person who never settles down in one place will not be successful. Another is that someone who is always moving, with no roots in one place, avoids responsibilities. This proverb was said to be first used in the 1500s. But in the 1960s, the expression \"rolling stone\" became famous in the world of rock-and-roll music. It became the name of a song, a rock group and a magazine. Experts say it all started with a song by the American singer and guitarist Muddy Waters. He was one of the country's top blues musicians until his death in 1983. His music influenced singers like Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. In 1950, Muddy Waters recorded a song called \"Rolling Stone\". A British rock group is said to have taken its name from Muddy Waters' song. The Rolling Stones performed for the first time in 1962.The group's members called themselves \"the world's greatest rock-and-roll band\". In 1965, Bob Dylan released his song \"Like a Rolling Stone\".It is one of his best known and most influential works. It is an angry song about a woman who was once rich and successful. But now she is on her own, \"with no direction home, like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone\". In 1967, a young man named Jann Wenner started a magazine and he named it \"Rolling Stone\". The magazine reported on rock music and the popular culture that the music created. By 1971, \"Rolling Stone\" had become the leading rock music and counterculture publication.

          "context": "Tobacco companies are fighting efforts in the United States and Australia to make their products less appealing. In Washington, a federal judge last week blocked the Food and Drug Administration from requiring new warning labels on cigarette packs. Judge Richard Leon ruled in a case brought by five tobacco companies. The judge temporarily stopped a new federal rule which requires large new warnings starting next September. These include color1 images such as a dead body or diseased lungs. And simple text warnings now appear. Congress called for color1 images showing the dangers of smoking, similar to what Canada does. But the tobacco companies say the new requirements approved in June violate their free speech rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Judge Leon said the FDA could not require the new labels before a lawsuit against the government is decided. Some experts say the process could take years. The judge said he believed the cigarette makers were highly likely to win their case. He said the images should be designed to appeal to emotions, rejecting government arguments that they should be purely factual. He accused the government of trying to use the labels to promote an \"obvious anti-smoking agenda?\" The head of an anti-smoking group, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called the decision \"wrong on the science and wrong on the law\". About one-fifth of American adults smoke. The World Health Organization says tobacco kills nearly six mil-lion people worldwide each year. More than six hundred thousand of them are non-smokers who breathe other people's tobacco smoke. In Australia, tobacco companies want to stop what would be the world's most restrictive laws on cigarette advertising. Cigarettes could be sold only in plain olive-green packages. Only the brand name and health warnings could appear. The Senate passed the bill last week and sent it back to the Lower House to approve minor amendments . The law is to go into effect in December of next year. Tobacco companies Say the legislation violates the Australian constitution. They say it would unjustly reduce the value of their brand names and trademarks. Health Minister Nicola Roxon says the government is ready for a legal fight.",

In the schools of ancient Greece and Rome, testing usually was made up of saying poetry aloud and giving speeches. In the European universities of the Middle Ages, students who were working for advanced degrees had to discuss questions in their field of study with people who had made a special study of the subject. This custom exists today as part of the process of testing candidates for the doctor's degree. Generally, however, modem examinations are written. The written examination, where all students are tested on the same questions, was probably not known until the nineteenth century. Perhaps it came into existence with the great increase in population and the development of modem industry. A room full of candidates for a state examination timed exactly by electric clocks and carefully watched over by managers, looks like a group of workers at an automobile factory. Certainly, during examinations teachers and students are expected to act like machines. One type of test is sometimes called an \"objective\" test. It is intended to deal with facts, not personal opinions. To make up an objective test, the teacher writes a series of questions, each of which has only one correct answer. Along with each question the teacher writes the correct answer and also three statements that look like answers to students who have not learned the material properly.",

Today, I want to talk to you about the historic opportunity we now have to protect our nation's children form an even more deadly threat: smoking. Smoking kills more people every day than AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, murders, suicides, drugs and fires combined. Nearly 90 percent of those smokers lit their first cigarette before they turned 18. Consider this: 3,000 children start to smoke every day illegally, and 1,000 of them will die sooner because of it. This is a national tragedy that every American should be honor-bound to help prevent. For more than five years we've worked to stop our children from smoking before they start, launching a nationwide campaign to educate them about the dangers of smoking, to reduce their access to tobacco products, and to severely restrict tobacco companies from advertising to young people. If we do these, we'll cut teen smoking by almost half over the next five years. That means if we act now, we have it in our power to stop 3 million children from smoking and to save a million lives as a result.",

It is obvious that we cannot increase demands for water much more without detrimental effects to the environment, society and the economy. It's all too easy to blame someone else for the water situation -\"if 70% of water is used for agriculture then that's what we should target\" - but it's not that easy. We all depend on the food and resources that agriculture provides, and while there are definitely opportunities to increase water efficiency on the farm, the solution will take more than that. We each share responsibility for the sustainable management of our water resources, which means using less water at home, in the workplace, at school, on holidays, on the farm, ... everyone, everywhere, every time. It's time to become water efficient! This involves reassessing our relationship with water, and learning to use it more sparingly. On the most basic level, it requires a behavioural change, and assigning a value to water that truly reflects its worth. We can also unlock economic benefits of being water efficient. There are many real world examples given in the case studies on this site. Everybody has a responsibility to save water, if future generations are to enjoy a similar standard of living to the one we enjoy now.

          "context": "An annoying problem for humans, who like to boast about all the distant planets and moons we have explored, is that we've never taken a good look right under our noses. The inside of the earth is relatively close, but how can we get there? The deepest oil well enters a mere six miles into the crust (the center of the earth is about 4,000 miles deeper). Russian scientists dug the deepest hole in Siberia, but bottomed out at about 7.5 miles below the surface. The Mohole project, a U.S. plan in the 1950s, called for drilling a hole 25 miles down to the boundary between the hard rocks of the crust and the soft mantle . Sadly the project involved government supporting. It gets harder and harder to drill deep into the earth because rocks get softer and softer. Hard but easily broken at the surface, rocks become plastic at depth, and the pressure caused by the weight of the overlaying crust --- about 52,800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles, makes further drilling impossible. What little we know about the inside of the earth (like the fact that there's a crust, a mantle, and a core) comes from indirect evidence, such as the analysis of earthquakes. So maybe it's time for a thorough new method to explore the earth's inside. Scientist David Stevenson says we should forget about drilling holes. Instead, we should open a crack . Stevenson suggests digging a crack about a half mile long, a yard wide, and a half mile deep (not with a shovel) but with an explosion on the scale of a nuclear bomb. Next, he'd pour a few hundred thousand tons of molten iron into the crack, along with a robot. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, would move downward at about 16 feet per second, carrying the robot with it and opening the crack deeper and deeper. The iron mass would drop for about a week and 2,000 miles to the outer edge of the earth core, the robot sending out data to the surface. Stevenson compares his idea to space exploration. \"We're going somewhere we haven't been before,\"he says. \"In all possibility, there will be surprises.\" This idea can probably be put in the drawer marked with Isn't Going To Happen. The robot would have to survive temperatures that would melt pretty much anything. But Stevenson's idea may inspire a new look at an old problem. Great things can come from what seems like impossible ideas.",

The reason for this is that our choice of color1 mirrors is how we are feeling. Those who don't believe in the idea are often heard saying, \"if only this truly worked\". Well in reply to those people, there has been a lot of research into what happens to someone's feelings when they are asked to wear just one color1 of clothes.

The final 3 weeks of Term 2 will be reserved tointroduce writing for TOEFL and CEE. By that time, if the students have done their job correctly, then they should be able to write quite well. As for the Latin course, I will post notices around campus next week so that the students will understand what's on offer before I actually introduce the course. A number of students already emailed me about the course. I am sure you don't understand what a big deal our opening this program at our school is. People around the world are interested in what we plan to do. There are many rewards available to the students who succeed in the course. Please share what I have said with the administration. I want them to understand the importance of this course. The reason I have contacted these colleagues (actually Oxford contacted me) isthatI have confidence in our students and in myself. I know that when those professors meet our students and hear them speaking and reading Latin, they are going to be amazed.

Going to a bar with friends is always pleasurable in slightly different ways. However, on the other hand, a table may also give us lots of positive experiences sometimes. I just moved from New York City to suburban Pennsylvania, It's been quite a change of pace, with some positives and negatives, One of the best parts is that I'm spending more time outside. I quite enjoy staying outside, especially eating outside. I had a goal to eat outside as often as possible this summer, so one of my first purchases for the new house was a table and a set of chairs for the yard. Is my yard table a thing or an experience? It's clearly a thing and yet it enables the experience of eating outside. I love eating outside, and so my yard table is one of my favorite purchases, ever. Therefore I find the dividing line between things and experiences is more nuanced than at first glance. However, to be happy, the most important thing is what kind of purchases you have made. Sometimes we may all have purchases that seem like a waste of money like probably half the clothes in our closets, but how does this happen?' There are many reasons for why this happens. The biggest is that we spend a lot of our time working to earn money to buy things. The problem is that we buy a lot of stuff that we don't actually need. There's nothing worse than looking in your closet and realizing how many hours you spent laboring to buy things you never wear. But how about a table that lets you enjoy being outside in the summer? That's worth every minute and penny and from it you will also get more happiness.",

          "context": "A third of primary schoolchildren in China are suffering from psychological ill-health as a result of classroom stress and parental pressure, according to a study published on Tuesday. The problem is so bad that urgent measures are needed, warns the study, led by British and Chinese researchers. The investigation surveyed 2,191 pupils aged nine to 12 in nine schools in urban and rural Zhejiang, a ly prosperous coastal province in eastern China. Eighty-one percent of the youngsters said they worried \"a lot\" about exams, 63 percent feared being punished by their teacher, 44 percent had been physically bullied at least sometimes - with boys likelier to be victims than girls - and 73 percent had been physically punished by their parents. Most of the children complained they struggled to cope with the amount of homework they were assigned. Over one-third reported headaches or abdominal pains - psychosomatic symptoms of stress - at least once a week. The most stressed children reported incidence of aches or pains of four times a week. The investigation, led by Therese Hesketh, a professor at University College London (UCL) Centre for International Health and Development, pointed the finger at extreme competitiveness in China's education system, from the onset of primary school. \"The competitive and punitive educational environment leads to high levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms,\" the authors say. \"Measures to reduce unnecessary stress on children in schools should be introduced urgently.\" The paper appears in Archives of Disease in Childhood, a peer-reviewed journal of the British Medical Association (BMA). The \"urban\" setting for the study was Hangzhou, the provincial capital of Zhejiang, while the \"rural\" setting was a poor county in Quzhou prefecture, in the west of the province. The study highlights some of the complexities that, it says, explain the demands for academic excellence and intolerance of failure. One factor is the country's dramatic rise in prosperity, which has created \"previously unheard-off possibilities for upward mobility\" and in turn stoked pressures on children to do well at school. Other reasons are China's one-child policy and the Confucian traditions of respect for parents and elders, filial piety, obedience and discipline. \"The aspirations of many parents, who had limited educational opportunities themselves are now invested in their only children,\" it says. Previous studies on school-related stress and its impact on health are few and generally come from Scandinavia. A 2008 assessment among 10- to 13-year-old in Sweden found that 21 percent of boys of 30 percent of girls experienced headache, and 17 percent of boys and 28 percent of girls experienced abdominal pain at least once per week.",

Robert Dane and his Solar Sailor were given the top prize at the Australian Design Awards recently. The Solar Sailor has been in use for six months. It uses four sources of energy for its power -- solar, wind, battery power with stored solar energy and a fuel generator in store all controlled by computers. The ferry can travel up to 7.5 knots on just wind and solar power. It's solar wings and fiberglass solar panels which not only take in sunlight and store it in batteries, but also act as sails. \"We angle our solar panels to the sun in two planes , which increases the amount of energy we get from the sun by 40 percent,\" Dane says. \"And also we can use that same structure to do another job, which is also the sail, and so these wing sails actually push the ferry forward just like a soft sail does.\" Computers check the sun and wind and angle the solar wings to take in the most sunlight. If there isn't much wind or it is a cloudy day, energy stored in the batteries runs the electric motor for up to five hours. \"If the batteries are too low, then the computer turns the generator on so the boat is always able to meet a commercial schedule, or get from point A to point B no matter what,\" Dan explains. Dane got his idea for the Solar Sailor from a book on insects. He was amazed how insects use their wings to collect solar energy to warm themselves. \"When I read that, I realized there was a good example in nature for what we were going to do, which was to use a solar wing to collect solar energy and also to sail,\" he says.",

Carnival celebrations are believed to have roots in the festival of Saturnalia, which, adapted to Christianity, became a farewell to bad things in a season of religious discipline to regret and prepare for Christ's death and coming back to life. Modern Brazilian Carnival dates back to Rio de Janeiro in 1641. It originally copied the European form of the festival, later taking in elements of Native American and African cultures. In the late 19th century, the strings were introduced in Rio de Janeiro. These were pageant groups that paraded through city avenues performing on instruments and dancing. Today they are known as blocks, consisting of a group of people who dress in costumes or special T-shirts with themes or logos. Blocks are generally connected with particular neighborhoods; they include both a music group and a lot of revelers. Block parades have become an expressive feature of Rio's Carnival. Today, they number more than 100 and the groups increase each year. Blocks can be formed by small or large groups of revelers with a clear title. Before the show, they gather in a square, then parade in sections of the city, often near the beach. Carnival time in Rio is very interesting, but is also the most expensive time to visit Rio. Hotel rooms and other lodgings can be up to four times more expensive than the regular rates. There are big crowds at some locations and life is far from ordinary in many parts of town.",

They were blue jeans and sport shirts. Some have long hair and some have short hair. Sometimes a boy has longer hair than a girl. Even the language is different. Students learn to say fire fighter instead of fireman, police officer instead of policeman, and letter carrier instead of mailman. A person does not need to be a man to fight a fire or to deliver the mail. Most people think that these changes are good. They give all people an equal chance to be happy and to do what they want to do with their lives. Fathers like to tell their sons that they can grow up to be president.

          "context": "Is it time to kick Russia out of the BRICs ? If so, it may end up sounding like a famous ball-point pen maker-BIC. An argument is being made that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device ,the BRICs, should really be the BICs. \"Is Russia really worth the name BRICs?\" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreigh Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of \"The Russian Balance Sheet\", thinks the Russia of Putin and Medvedev is just not worthy of inclusion alongside Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic powerhouses. He writes: \"The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one must ask whether it has any say at all on the global economy, compared with the other members of its group. I have just returned from Moscow, which is always dull around this season. For the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state has been living on oil and gas. \" Economically, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund figures that the Russian economy will fall by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There is less of a case for Brazil, with a fall of 0.7 percent, but it is still doing far better than Russia. But the BRICs are not just about economy. As is mentioned above, it is a marketing device to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment standpoint, it could be argued that Russia is leading the BRICs. Its stock market is up 128 percent this year while around 80 percent is for the other three. At very least, however, Russia's economic underperformance and stock market outperfoumance does suggest it is indeed one of the group.",

          "context": "Many parents try hard to protect their kids from TV and Internet advertising. But how can you protect a child from a large fast-food ad painted on her school locker ? Or a toy ad on the side of his school bus? As school budgets get smaller, a growing number of schools in the US are selling, advertising space on lockers and buses and in gyms or cafeterias. It is an easy way for schools to make money. And ads may provide relief for parents exhausted by making cash donations to support schools. While parents can always turn off the televisions or the computers, they can't keep advertising out of schools. This isn't the first time the issue has come up. For example, a news program for teens has been criticized for including ads in its 12-minute classroom broadcasts. And parents' groups successfully fought a plan by a company called Bus Radio to put music and ads into school buses. But now things are different. Just last month, Los Angeles approved a plan to allow companies to advertise in the district's schools. Officials say the plan could provide as much as $18 million for the schools. In St. Francis, Minn., schools recently agreed to cover 10% to 15% of their lockers with ads. Time says. Edward Saxton, a teacher in the school, says, \"So far, parents are accepting this as a way to bring in needed money. The money pays for programs like arts, sports and music. Parents don't like to see programs getting cut. Neither do I. Besides, schools are thinking about the effects on kids all the time.\" However, Susan Linn, an educational expert, says, \"Kids have already seen enough ads on TV, in magazines and the products they use daily. School is no place for advertisements at all.\" Readers, what about you? Would you rather help run yet another school fundraiser, or expose your child to ads on lockers and buses? Is keeping ads out of schools worth raising taxes, or increasing your own cash support for school through donations?",

Lady Gaga and the Sociology of the Fame is to be taught by Professor Mathieu Deflem, a fan of the singer. The course, which has its own blog, is due to start in spring 2011. The Belgian born sociologist, whose research interests also include counter-terrorism, international policing, crime control and internet technology, says he has seen Lady Gaga in concert 30 times. \"We're going to look at Lady Gaga as a social event,\" Prof Deflem told the USC student newspaper, the Daily Gamecock. \"So it's not the person, and it's not the music. It's more this thing out there in society that has 10 million followers on Facebook and six million on Twitter. I mean, that's a social phenomenon.\". It will look at business and marketing strategies, the role of old and new media, fans and live concerts, gay culture, religious and political themes, sex and sexuality, and the cities of New York and Hollywood, it says. Prof Deflem said he initially planned to call the course the Sociology of Fame or the Sociology of Celebrity, and to use Lady Gaga as an example. Also a fan of Frank Zappa, Prince, Led Zeppelin, Alice Cooper, Status Quo and Ritchie Blackmore, Prof Deflem says his interest in Lady Gaga began when he first saw her perform on television on 9 January 2009. \"They don't have to be hardcore fans. The better fan will not necessarily be the better student. But you have to have some interest in the topic. So if you really don't like her, you probably shouldn't take the course.\"",

Every spring wine growers get together to celebrate the beginning of another grape-growing season at the Okanagan Spring Wine Festival. The best time to visit the Okanagan is usually from May 1 to 10. The festival allows visitors to taste the best wines in Canada together with unique dishes representing the latest developments in local cuisine. The jazz festival Montreal's downtown comes alive every summer during the International Jazz Festival. The Festival International de Jazz de Montreal is an annual jazz festival held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The Montreal Jazz Fest held the 2004 Guinness World Record as the world's largest jazz festival. This year the event is scheduled to run from June 29 to July 9. Stages replace cars along busy streets. With a host of free outdoor shows, you'll be snapping your fingers to anything from Dixieland to blues, African beats to modern trip-hop, and everything in between. Are you ready? Just head east to the Newfoundland Targa Rally, which runs from September 9 to 16 this year. The 2,200-kilometre race dashes across the eastern and central parts of the province, and is the largest race of its kind in North America. On these sections you race against the clock rather than other competitors. This is a great chance to test your car's limits and your skills. Hello spring! In 1945, thousands of tulip bulbs gifts from Holland, were planted on Ottawa's Parliament Hill, Canada. These gifts were a thank-you to Canadian soldiers who helped set Holland free in World WarII. Since then, the capital has become home to the Canadian Tulip Festival. From May 4 to 22, Ottawa and Gatineau (a city of southwest Quebec) will be covered with beautiful flowers. Besides three million tulips, visitors can also attend concerts, featuring some of Canada's brightest musical stars.",

It was a busier day than usual for me with a couple of meetings besides my regular work. Years ago, I would have put off my workout and would have left things for the next day. But since it was a busy day as well, I knew that I may not have all that much time either. So, I picked up my kettle-bell and _ for 4 minutes. See, 4 minutes, if that's all you've got, is enough to give your body a great fat-burning exercise. How did I get a killer workout in 4 minutes? I used a training workout discovered 10 years ago by a Japanese Sports Scientist called a TABATA. It includes 20-second periods of warm-up, followed by 10-second periods of rest and 4-minute straight exercise. How is a 4-minute exercise able to burn fat? It all depends on the quality of work you do. Not on the quantity. Here's how I did it yesterday. You should never forget your warm-up. A TABATA workout is 20 seconds of 2-arm Kettle-bell swings, 10 seconds rest, 20 seconds push-ups, and 10 seconds rest. You should do those 4 rounds. That's it. I was done in a total time of 8 minutes by the time and when I got to school my heart was still pumping pretty hard. A healthy body is needed for studying and working, and efficiency is the key to building a great body in the least amount of time possible and you can't get more efficient than a 4-minute workout.",

Plants were growing out of the roofs, and trees were growing in the courtyards. Today, the temple is the scene of a busy repair program. A team of 15 Indian experts are organizing a workforce of 400 Cambodians, most of them women, who are cleaning, repairing and rebuilding parts of this temple. As I walked through the courtyards, I noticed the Cambodian women devote hours to cleaning carefully a tiny area of stone. Boards are laid down to protect the precious painted stones while the repair work is going on. There are very few machines and little heavy equipment. Workers carry building materials in buckets at the end of long poles. Piles of stones lie in a corner of the courtyard, waiting to be replaced. The work of cleaning the stones is watched over by three Indian chemists. It is a very slow task. First they clean the stones with brushes using buckets of a weak chemical. Then gaps between the stones are filled in. Finally another material is painted onto the stones which will protect them from water forever. Work starts every day at 7 a. m. and goes on until late afternoon six days a week, with a break at midday. Evening is the best time to visit the temple, after the tour groups have left. As the sun sinks lower, shadows spread across the courtyard. After sunset, the sky turns pink. The grey stone towers take on a golden color before turning pink. Nowhere else in the world can there be such a quiet, beautiful place.",

A good book may absorb our attention so completely that for the time being we forget our surroundings and even our identity. Reading good books is one of the greatest pleasures in life. It increases our contentment when we are cheerful, and lessens our troubles when we are sad. Whatever may be our main purpose in reading, our contact with good books should never fail to give us enjoyment and satisfaction. With a good book in our hands we need never be lonely. Whether the characters in it are taken from real life or are purely imaginary, they may become our companions and friends. In the pages of books we can walk with the wise and the good of all lands and all times. The people we meet in books may delight us either because they resemble human friends whom we hold dear or because they present unfamiliar types whom we are glad to welcome as new acquaintances . Our human friends sometimes may bore us, but the friends we make in books need never weary us with their company. By turning the page we can dismiss them without any fear of hurting their feelings. While human friends desert us, good books are always ready to give us friendship, sympathy, and encouragement. Of all the gifts from reading books, the most valuable one is experience. Few of us can travel far from home or have a wide range of experiences, but all of us can lead varied lives through the pages of books. Whether we wish to escape from the seemingly dull realities of daily routines or whether we long to visit some far-off place, a book will help us when nothing else can. To travel by book we need no bank account to pay our way; no airship or ocean liner or stream-lined train to transport us; no passport to enter the land of our heart's desire. Through books we may get the thrill of _ adventure without danger. We can climb high mountains, brave the perils of an Antarctic winter, or cross the scorching sands of the desert, all without hardship. In books we may visit the studios of Hollywood; we may mix with the merry crowds of the Paris boulevards; we may join the picturesque peasants in an Alpine village or the kindly natives on a South Sea island. Indeed, through books _ . The possibilities of our literary experiences are almost unlimited. The beauties of nature, the enjoyment of music, the treasures of art, the triumphs of architecture, the marvels of engineering, are all open to the wonder and enjoyment of those who read.",

Airlines have stopped or changed the flights across the Atlantic Ocean, leaving hundreds of passengers stuck in airports. Grimsvotn is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Europe. What makes Grimsvotn different is that it lies under a huge glacier of ice up to 12 metres thick. The hot volcano heats up the ice above it, which then forms a layer of water between glacier and the volcano, keeping it stable. As the water flows out from under the glacier, the pressure lifts. The lava from the volcano then comes up to the surface. This is exactly what is happening today. Now airlines have to make changes to their flights so as not to fly through the clouds of volcanic ash. According to KLM, one of Europe's biggest airlines, airplanes cannot go under the cloud or over it. Going through the cloud can result in ash getting stuck in the airplane's engines, causing damage to the plane. The eruption has also caused problems for animals in Iceland. The volcano left ash and sharp, glass-like rocks all over the countryside. Farmers are keeping their animals inside to stop them eating ash-covered grass or the sharp objects.",

          "context": "More and more people take part in marathons these days - over 30,000 people will run the London Marathon this weekend, for instance. But it's not just the 26 miles and 385 yards that could be a daunting prospect. \"I have to admit to being completely frustrated by the blocking and for 18-19 miles was just keeping away from people and being held up,\" one participant grumbled after the 2012 London Marathon. \"I had to overtake a lot of people and ended up with bruised forearms from all the elbows,\" said another. How do such crowding problems arise, and could they be reduced? Some researchers believe that we can find the answers through a more familiar system in which jams appear - road traffic flow. Martin Treiber, of the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, has previously developed models for traffic flow. One of the first attempts to model traffic flow was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham of Manchester University. They considered the traffic as a kind of liquid flowing down a pipe, and looked at how the flow changes as the fluid gets denser . At first the flow rate increases as the density increases, since you simply get more stuff through in the same period of time. But if the density becomes too high, there's a risk of jams, and the flow rate drops sharply. Treiber's model of a marathon uses this same principle that the flow rate first increases and then decreases as the density of runners increases, thanks to an sudden switch from free to crowded flow. He assumes that there is a range of different preferred speeds for different runners, which each maintains throughout the race. With just these factors, Treiber can calculate the flow rate of runners, knowing the \"carrying capacity\" at each point on the route. This allows Treiber to figure out how blocking might depend on the race conditions - for example, for different starting procedures. Some marathons start by letting all the runners set off at once (which means those at the back have to wait until those in front have moved forward). Others assign runners to various groups according to ability, and let them start in a series of waves. Treiber has applied the model to the annual Rennsteig half-marathon in central Germany, which attracts around 6,000 participants. The traditional route had to be changed in 2013, because the police were no longer willing to close a road to ensure that runners could cross safely. It could pass either over a 60m wooden bridge or through a tunnel. Treiber used his model to predict the likely blocking caused in the various options. The model predicted that a mass start would risk an overload of runners if the bridge were to be used. Only by moving the starting point further back from the bridge could the danger be avoided - and even then, if some of the numbers assumed in the model were only slightly inaccurate, there was still a risk of jams at the bridge. On the other hand, no dangerous blocking seemed likely for the tunnel route. The run organizers consulted Treiber's team, and eventually chose this option.",

The Imperial College London researchers who published their results online said the discovery could lead to more effective cough treatment. \"While coughing is not necessarily harmful it can have a major effect on the quality of life, and this discovery could be a huge step forward in treating this problem,\" said Professor Peter Barnes. Ten healthy volunteers were given theobromine, codeine or placebo, a pill that contains no medicine, during the experiment. Neither the volunteers nor the researchers knew who received which pill. The researchers then measured levels of capsaicin, which is used in research to cause coughing and as a sign of how well the medicines are stopping coughs. The team found that, when the volunteers were given theobromine, the capsaicin needed to produce a cough was around a third higher than in the placebo group. When they were given codeine they needed only slightly higher levers of capsaicin to cause a cough compared with the placebo. The researchers said that theobromine worked by keeping down a nerve activity , which cause coughing. They also found that unlike some standard cough treatments, theobromine caused no side effects such as sleepiness.",

It was constructed between 1980 and 1983. This fountain shoots water in an incredible 1023-foot (312m) height which is greater than the height of the Eifel Tower.

You can build your confidence by following some suggestions from doctors and psychologists. Make a decision not to hold back in conversations. What you have to say is just as important as what other people say. And don't turn down party invitations just because of your shyness. Prepare for yourself for being with others in groups. Make a list of the good qualities you have. Then make a list of ideas, experiences, and skills you would like to share with other people . I think about what you would like to say in advance. Then say it. If you start feeling self-conscious in a group, take a deep breath and focus your attention on other people, Remember, you are not alone. Other people are concerned about the impression they are making, too. No one ever gets over being shy completely, but most people do learn to live with their shyness. Even entertainers admit that they often feel shy. They work at fighting their shy feelings so that they can face the cameras and the public. Just making the effort to control shyness can have many rewards. But perhaps the best reason to fight shyness is to give other people a chance to know about you.",

          "context": "A house of cards? Sounds unbelievable, doesn't it? Not if the architect is 31-year-old Bryan Berg. He's made a career out of building fantastic card houses, stadiums, capitols, castles -- and the world's tallest card tower. How does he do it? Bryan's structures are amazing because they are made entirely of perfectly balanced, freestanding playing cards. He never uses glue, tape, or anything else to hold the cards together. Nor does he fold the cards. He's discovered another way to make a strong house of cards, using a trick from nature. To make plants strong, nature builds them with cells that have tough walls. Rows and rows of these cells form a grid that helps leaves and stems keep their shape. Bees use the same kind of repeating pattern to create strong honeycombs, where they live and store honey. Bryan designs similar grids, using cards to create a repeating pattern of cells. He begins with a single cell made by balancing four cards against one another to form a box. Then he repeats the cell over and over, expanding outward to form the grid, which makes a good foundation for a strong card structure. The larger the grid, the more weight it can carry. Sometimes Bryan uses several cards, instead of just one, to construct the cell walls, making the grid even stronger. The trick, he tells kids when he speaks in classrooms, is to place your cards as tightly together as possible when laying out your grid, making sure the cards are not leaning at all. After building this solid base, Bryan lays cards across the top to make the floor for the next \"story\" of the building. He may add towers, columns, steeples, or domes. Using the principle of repeating cells, Bryan builds structures of amazing strength. In the Cards Not surprisingly, Bryan has always been interested in building things. Growing up on a \"big, old farm\" in rural Iowa, he had plenty of room to play. \"We were in the middle of nowhere,\" Bryan remembers, \"with lots of space to do whatever we wanted. I was always making something, using things like sticks or bales of hay.\" Bryan's grandfather taught him how to stack cards. Bryan's two interests -- building and card stacking -- soon combined. But stacking in his family's farmhouse was challenging. \"Our old house had wood floors that weren't all level,\" he reports. \"And they weren't very firm. When people walked around, it was like 'earthquake action.' It was a challenge to build something that wouldn't fall down immediately.\" Bryan constructed tower after tower; he went through a lot of trial and error before he built anything taller than himself. When he placed a few decks of cards on top of his grid, he discovered how strong it was. Bryan's towers began to grow taller. How Tall Is Too Tall? Bryan's first Guinness World Record for the world's tallest card tower came in the spring of 1992, when he was in high school. Learning that the world record was 12 feet 10 inches, Bryan built a slim tower that topped out at 14 feet 6 inches. Done as a project for his geometry class, it took him 40 hours and 208 decks of cards. Since then he's gone on to win world records for even taller buildings. His latest winner measured 25 feet 3.5 inches and used about 2,400 decks of cards. _ Why don't these towers fall down? The key is in a good solid base, a repeating pattern of stories, and a tapering top. Bryan likes to point out how card buildings resemble real ones. They are built cell by cell, story by story. The separate parts make one strong whole. The heavier the building, the stronger and more stable it is. But the weight can't all be at the top. After spending so much time building something so cool, Bryan admits it's sometimes painful to see his structures destroyed. But he compares his work to the building of a sandcastle or an ice sculpture. ",

If we do not get enough of the vitamins we need in our food, we are at risk of developing a number of diseases. Which foods should be eaten to keep us healthy? Let us look at some important vitamins. Vitamin A helps prevent skin and other tissues from becoming dry. People who do not get enough vitamin A cannot see well in darkness. Vitamin A is found in fish liver oil and the yellow part of eggs. Vitamin B-1 is also called thiamine. Thiamine changes starchy foods into energy. Thiamine is found not just in whole grains like brown rice, but also in beans and peas, nuts, and meat and fish. Vitamin B-12 is needed so folic acid can do its work. Together, they help produce red blood cells. Folic acid has been shown to prevent physical problems in babies when taken by their mothers during pregnancy. Vitamin B-12 is found naturally in foods like eggs, meat, fish and milk products. Vitamin B-12 is found in green leafy vegetables and other foods, like legumes and citrus fruits . Vitamin C is needed for strong bones and teeth. The body stores little vitamin C. So we must get it every day in foods such as citrus fruits, tomatoes and uncooked cabbage. Vitamin D prevents the children's bone disease rickets . Ultraviolet light from the sun changes a substance in the skin into vitamin D. Fish liver oil also contains vitamin D. Vitamin K is needed for healthy blood. It thickens the blood around a cut to stop bleeding. It can also be found in pork products, liver and in vegetables like cabbage, kale and spinach . Vitamins are important to our health. A lack of required vitamins can lead to health problems.",

After releasing a popular record in November 2009, his album My world 2.0 came out last Tuesday. Bieber sings ballads and songs about puppy love. But is he just another gooey teen idol? David Malitz, a columnist with the Washington Post, doesn't think so. \"If we truly want the best forAmerican children, let us pause and give thanks for Justin Bieber,\" he writes. \"After years of humdrum bubblegum from Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers, the 16yearold has thrown a candycoated wrench into Disney's heartthrob assembly line by giving young fans something worth screaming their lungs out for lovable pop songs.\" From a boy who grew up below the poverty line with his divorced mom to a star who caused nearriots in shopping malls, even Bieber himself can't believe his overnight fame, although his kind of success is becoming more and more common in the Internet era. Interested in hockey, the national sport of Canada, the boy once put up pictures of players on the walls of his bedroom. He dreamed of being a hockey star and used to practice signing his autograph.

Shalimar Jacques Guerlain created this vanilla fragrance in 1925. The perfume takes its name from the Garden of Shalimar, which was built by Emperor Shah Jehan for one of his wives.

L'Air duTemps Francis Farbon created Nina Ricci's L'Air du Temps in 1948. The fragrance is known for its spicy carnation and gardenia scents as well as its beautiful crystal bottle (designed by Lalique). Eternity Calvin Klein's second perfume was created by Sophia Grojsman in 1988. Known for its light, flowery scent, the perfume was listed in the Fragrance Hall of Fame in 2003. It is recommended for daytime wear. Angel This wildly popular perfume was created in 1992 by Olivier Cresp for Thierry Mugler. The perfume was an instant success.

Well, to understand this, you simply just look back at how you felt when you heard music in these places. Music is known to improve the mood of people. Often music helps us pay attention to what we are doing. Music helps patients feel good and helps them recover faster and better. Depression is a state of mind that most of us experience at some point of time. There are some periods in our life when everything seems difficult. It seems that everything is getting worse and we have no control over our life. Studies have shown that music can be an important mood lifter in such situations. Music also plays a great role in making us feel less nervous or worried. Anxiety can often cause loss of sleep and other illnesses. Music is often known as an international language. We may not know the language another person is speaking, but most of us respond to music in the same way. Music can often be the best way to connect with someone. Music is one of the best ways to improve your moods, but this can depend largely on the kind of music you listen to. While happy music can certainly make you feel better, sad music can further lower your spirits. Listening to classical music can often make you feel a lot more powerful, while soft music can be the perfect way to relax at the end of a long way. If you want to use music to change the way how you are feeling, you need to understand the role of it, learn to recognize the kind of music that lifts your mood and helps you feel better. Once you realize the kind of music you can use, you can use it to change the way you feel. The right kind of music can be the perfect way to help us feel happier.",

          "context": "Smoking bans in public places are linked with falls in childhood asthma attacks and preterm births , according to the biggest analysis of the influence of public smoking bans on child health. The finding should remove fears that such laws could have the opposite effect because they may lead people to smoke more at home. Several countries, such as Japan and Australia, have tightened laws on smoking in public places over the last few years. Meanwhile, some countries, such as the Netherlands and Germany, still allow smoking in pubs and restaurants. Only about half of US states have comprehensive bans, and there are few restrictions in poorer nations. Opponents often claim that bans could result in people smoking more at home, which would be worse for their children's health. Asthma is one of the main concerns as second-hand smoke harms children's airways in several ways. Researchers led by Jasper Been at Maastricht University Medical Centre reviewed as many as 11 studies that examined how hospital admissions for childhood asthma and preterm births changed after smoking bans came in. The studies involved more than 2.5 million births, and nearly 250,000 hospital admissions for asthma. The result shows that both asthma admissions and preterm birth rates fell by about 10 percent within a year after smoking restrictions were carried out. The effect on preterm births could also have been caused by pregnant women being more likely to quit or cut down following a public ban, says Been. But Been also says the studies could not completely prove that smoking bans directly caused these changes. However, as a matter of fact, because the analysis included several smoking bans introduced in different countries in different years, and most saw health improvements. Such findings are useful for countries and states where there is ongoing debate about how strict smoking bans should be, especially as hospital care for premature babies is so expensive. This might be one of the most important things to know in order to strengthen legislation . Other studies have shown that rates of heart attack and stroke also tend to fall after smoking bans are introduced.",

          "context": "Spanish men will have to learn to change diapers and do dishwashing under the terms of a new law designed to strike a blow. The law, due to be passed this month, is likely to cause a revolution in family affairs in a country where 40% of men reportedly don't do housework at all. It will oblige men to \"share domestic responsibilities and the care and attention\" of children and elderly family members, according to the draft approved by the Spanish parliament's justice commission. \"This will be a good way of reminding people what their duties are. It is something feminists have been wanting for a long time,\" said Margarita Uria, of the Basque Nationalist Party, who was behind what is an amendment to a new divorce law. Failure to meet the obligations will be taken into consideration by judges when determining the terms of divorces. Men who refuse to do their part may be given less frequent contact with their children. Spanish women spend five times longer on housework than husbands. Even when both have jobs outside the home, Spanish women still do three times as much work in the house. \"It is not just about housework, though,\" said Ms. Uria. A study five years ago by Spain's Center for Sociological Investigation concluded that fathers spent an average of 13 minutes each day looking after their children. Only 19 % of Spanish men thought it was right for mothers of school-age children to have a full-time job. More than a third thought mothers should not work outside the home at all. The Change to the Spanish legal code will see domestic obligations added to a list of marital duties that currently includes fidelity, living together and helping one another. That should guarantee that, when the law--which will also make divorce proceedings faster and easier--is voted on in parliament in the next few weeks, the obligation to share domestic chores will be added to the statute books.",

          "context": "It was a comfortable sunny Sunday. I was going to meet an old university friend I hadn't seen for years, and was really excited to hear all his news. My train was running a little late, but that was no big problem - I could text him to say I would be delayed. He would understand. But... where was my mobile phone? I had that familiar sinking feeling. Yes, I'd forgotten it at home. No mobile phone. I'm sure I'm not alone in feeling anxious, _ and worried when I don't have my phone with me. In fact, I know I'm not alone: two-thirds of us experience 'nomophobia', the fear of being out of mobile phone contact. That's according to a study from 2012 which surveyed 1,000 people in the UK about their relationship with mobile phones. It says we check our mobile phones 34 times a day, that women are more 'nomophobic'than men, and that 18-24 year-olds are the most likely to suffer fear of being without their mobiles: 77% of them say they are unable to be apart from their phones for more than a few minutes. Do you have nomophobia ? * You never turn your phone off * You obsessively check for texts, missed calls and emails* You always take your phone to the bathroom with you* You never let the battery run out It's funny to think that around 20 years ago the only people with mobile phones would be businessperson carrying their large, plastic 'bricks'. Of course, these days, mobile phones are everywhere. A UN study from this year said mobile phone subscriptions would outnumber people across the world by the end of 2014. And when there are more phones than people in the world, maybe it's time to ask who really is in charge? Are you in control of your phone, or does your phone control you? So, what happened with my university friend? When I arrived a few minutes late he just laughed and said: \"You haven't changed at all - still always late!\" And we had a great afternoon catching up, full of jokes and stories, with no interruptions and no nagging desire to check my phone. Not having it with me felt strangely liberating. Maybe I'll leave it at home on purpose next time.",

Musicians often called him Pops, as a sign of respect for his influence on the world of music. Born in 1901 in New Orleans, he grew up poor, but lived among great musicians. Jazz was invented in the city a few years before his birth. Armstrong often said,\"Jazz and I grew up together.\" Armstrong showed a great talent for music when he was taught to play the cornet at a boy's home. In his late teens, Armstrong began to live the life of a musician. He played in parades, clubs, and on the steam-boats that travelled on the Mississippi River. At that time, New Orleans was famous for the new music of jazz and was home to many great musicians. Armstrong learned from the older musicians and soon became respected as their equal. In 1922 he went to Chicago. There, the tale of Louis Armstrong begins. From then until the end of his life, Armstrong was celebrated and loved wherever he went. Armstrong had no equal when it came to playing the American popular song. His cornet playing had a deep humanity and warmth that caused many listeners to say,\"Listening to Pops just makes you feel good all over.\"He was the father of the jazz style and also one of the best-known and most-admired people in the world.

          "context": "You're in your office when you learn there's someone with a gun wandering outside. You can hear gunshots and screams. What do you do? That's the challenge for users of a new virtual reality program called SurviVR, designed to train employees how to deal with an active shooter situation in the workplace. The program works with HTC Vive, the virtual reality headset released earlier this year. An active shooter situation is when an armed person or people actively shoot in a small, populated area with the intention to kill. There were 20 such situations in the United States last year and 20 the year before, according to FBI statistics, resulting in a total of 231 deaths. This year saw the deadliest active shooter situation in US history , with 49 people killed in a nightclub in Orlando. In the training situation, users have four choices. They can lock themselves in the office. They can hide, perhaps in the office closet. They can run for an exit. Or they can use something in the office--a computer or a cup a pair of scissors-as a weapon to fight the shooter. This is an improvement on standard active shooter training. Gallo says, which typically teachers people to lock themselves in place and hide. The \"lock down\" method is often ineffective, he says, and has resulted in many deaths in recent years. In the training's basic level, no one gets killed. But as the trainings become more advanced, players who make a wrong choice be shot. There's no blood; the screen simply turns black slowly. If this sounds terrifying, that's the point, says Gallo. There are plenty of training programs to teach employees how to deal with workplace violence, sometimes involving role play with toy guns. But these trainings are basically games. Gallo says, with employees relaxed and even enjoying themselves. To teach people what they really need to know for an active shooter situation, they need to be scared. \"SurviVR will take the fear and turn it into confidence.\" Gallo says.",

The taste is simply irresistible , the smell is inviting and the feel of every bite is surely what you are longing for. Apart from the taste, you simply cannot resist it because it has a lot of benefits when it comes to your health. Our health is our priority when it comes to the choice of our foods. If you worry that the chocolate is bad for your health, then here is a list of the effects of dark chocolate to health especially when taken with the right amount every day. First of all , it contains a component called falconoid which acts as an antioxidant . The antioxidants fight the common signs of aging. The antioxidants are also good for the heart. Studies have shown that people who ate foods rich in antioxidants have low risk of heart diseases. In addition to the anti-aging and healthy heart benefits, the dark chocolate can also lower blood pressure and reduce bad cholesterol to as high as 10%. Lowering of blood pressure in patients of high blood level is good because it will lower the risks of stroke and certain health crisis. Low levels of blood cholesterol are also good for the heart and take away the risk of blood vessels which may harden for too much cholesterol in them. Lastly, do you know the feeling of being overjoyed after jogging? This feeling is like extreme happiness. Dark chocolates will give you the feeling of pleasure and happiness. If you are feeling that the world has turned against you, then a chocolate can be a mood lifter. It can help fight depression. Usually when we feel so bad, we would crave to eat more food. If you are looking for something to eat during your bad moments, try to take a bite from a dark chocolate and feel good somehow after it. These are commonly the effects of chocolates to health. It can benefit you especially if taken in moderate amounts. Approximately, 100 grams of chocolate or less a day is already enough according to studies. If you have taken too much, try to lessen on your other meals for the day. It is all about nutrition and taking the right amount of food in order to get the health benefits that it can provide for you.",

Now Copenhagen, the country's capital, has become the center of the world political map, with 190 world leaders attending the climate talks there, not to mention thousands of reporters. Just how much do you know about the Scandinavian country? Denmark is famous for its design culture. At the heart of \"Danish Design\" is the idea that, as poet and designer Piet Hein puts it: \"There is one art, not more, nor less, [and that is] to do all things with artlessness .\" Danish design places equal emphasis on practicality and quality. From Lego toys to furniture, Danish products are known for their clean lines, simplicity and functionality. \"Remove material where it's not needed. Keep things simple and functional and make them carefully,\" explained Hans J. Wegner, the first Danish designer to achieve worldwide fame: \"The aim is not to create a work of art, but to produce a good chair.\" \"The Danes have done a better job than most in promoting arts in Europe, considering their country's size and population, in the fields of architecture, sculpture and design,\" writes Helena Smith, reporter with British newspaper the Guardian. The simplicity of Danish design may extend to the quality of life there. Some even claim that the Danes have the highest quality of life of any nation in the world. Kate Vial, a 55-year-old American who has lived and worked in Denmark for more than 30 years, explaining why she chooses to live in Denmark rather than the US, told Germany's biggest news weekly Der Spiegel: \"I just chose a simpler lifestyle, one where I could ride my bike all over and where I don't have to make a great living to survive.\"",

I'm really tired, but my first day at school went well and I feel much better now. First of all, we had to meet outside the school building. I was very nervous because my primary school only had 300 pupils but in the secondary school there are about 1,300. What a difference! The older pupils are really big. I felt so small waiting there in front of the school. The other problem was that I didn't know anyone. My family moved over the summer holidays, because of Dad's new job. So now I have to try to make some new friends. Standing in front of the school this morning, I wanted to be back at my old school with my old friends. The head teacher came out and told us to go into the school hall. Then he called our names out to tell us which class we were in. My class teacher is called Mrs. Black. She took us to our classroom. It's on the 5th floor and ... guess what? ... We aren't allowed to use the lift. I couldn't believe it. When we were walking up all the stairs I started talking to another boy who didn't know anyone. He said his family had moved from Hong Kong over the summer. He seemed really nice so we sat together when we got to our classroom, out of breath! He said his English was very poor but I thought it was really good. We spent all morning with Mrs. Black looking at our timetables. Everyone in the school has a different timetable--can you believe it? Half of the school is learning Spanish as a second language and the other half learns French. I'm in the Spanish group, which sounds like fun. I'm worried that I'll forget my timetable and go to the wrong room! How will anyone help me if nobody else has the same timetable as me? Lunchtime was OK. After lunch we started lessons. I had maths, which was complicated and difficult and then history, where we started to learn about ancient Greece. That looks interesting. I have to do some homework tonight to find out how the ancient Greek people lived. So far so good. I'm quite looking forward to tomorrow, even though I've got science. I hate science! Jason",

As they were doing so, a huge net fell on them and trapped them all. The pigeons were taken aback. They noticed a hunter sitting at a distance from the tree, a bow and arrow in hand. The pigeons realized it was the hunter who had trapped them in the net. The hunter got up and began to move towards the pigeons. The leader of the pigeons spoke, \"Friends, we are in great trouble. The hunter will catch us if we do not act swiftly in a few seconds. There is only one _ available at this moment. Let all of us use our force together and fly up along with the net.

Many countries still follow the lunar calendar, meaning that their new year often starts in late January or in February. New Year celebrations for some countries (like China, Vietnam and Korea) last not one day, but up to two weeks! In the U.S., many people attend New Year parties. They drink champagne, dance, and cheer at the stroke of midnight. Fireworks, which in olden times scared away evil spirits, are very popular throughout the U. S. . U.S. residents often make one or more New Year's _ such as promising to quit smoking, lose weight, stop drinking. Most of these resolutions last little longer than a month. In the southern U.S. , many people eat black-eyed peas for good luck in the new year. In Mexico and Venezuela, many people wear red or yellow underwear for good luck. In Brazil, residents wear red white clothes for good luck, and in China, they wear red clothes and give children red envelops with money in them. In Iran, people wear brand new clothes on the first day of the new year. In Scotland, homeowners open the front door at midnight to let in the new year, and open the back door to let out the old year. In Switzerland, people kiss each other three times at midnight. In Spain, people eat 12 grapes-----one per chime----as the clock chimes midnight. In Japan, they ring a bell 108 times to get rid of the108 bad desires that people have. In Korea, they ring a bell 33 times in honor of 33 ancient soldiers.",

Alexander Klose, CEO of Volvo Cars China, told Xinhua at the Ninth Tianjin International Automobile Trade Show, being held from Friday to Wednesday. Klose said Volvo Cars had entered a new time of fast development, adding that its sales volume in China in 2010. Up to the end of September, Volvo's global sales volume was up 12.5 percent year on year , compared with 52 percent year-on-year rise in China, he said. Two new Volvo sales centers opened in Beijing within merely one week in early October, about two months after east China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co acquired the Swedish brand from the US auto giant Ford for $1.5 billion in early August. Klose said he was confident of seeing tremendous growth in China's auto market in the next five years. \"As the Chinese government has increased the tax rate for large displacement cars already, we now have a lot of cars below three liters , and I think we'll stick to that strategy, as you can see now the XC60 which was introduced today is just two liters,\" he said. \"As the technology advances, we'll probably even see 1.6 liter engines or 1.5 liter engines in the future,\" he added. Volvo Cars is not the only automaker hoping to take advantage of China's rapidly growing auto market. Bentley, the famous British luxury carmaker, will open a new sales center in China at Tianjin Thursday, which is the 11th one in China, according to a press release by Shanghai-based Zenith Integrated Communications Corp (Zenith) Saturday at the auto show. Zenth is the public relations agent of Bentley in China. The automaker has sold 421 limousines to China in 2009, and the goal for 2010 is 777, the release said.",

          "context": "Marriages improve after children grow up and move out,according to an academic study, which suggests an \"empty nest\" is not always a bad thing. Popular wisdom has it that parents' relationships may suffer once their young fly the coop, because they feel they have lost their purpose in life.However, a new study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, has found that many couples actually feel happier when their children leave home because they are able to enjoy spending time together. In total,123 American mothers born in the 1930s were tracked for 18 years and asked to rate their satisfaction levels shortly after marrying, when they were bringing up babies, once their children reached their teenage years and finally at age 61, when almost all had \"empty nests\". Although not all said they were happier in general, most claimed their marriages had improved since their children had left home. Researchers believe this is not just because the spouses were spending more time together, but because they were able to enjoy each other's company more. One of the participants in the study,which is published in the journal Psychological Science,said:\"Once the kids grow up...there's some of that stress removed...that responsibility removed,so things are a little more relaxed.\" Psychologist Sara Gorchoff,who carried out the investigation,said: \"The takehome message for couples with young children is 'hang in there'.\" Her coauthor Oliver John added:\"Don't wait until your kids leave home to schedule quality time with your partner.\" However, Dr Dorothy Rowe,from the British Psychological Society,said the effects of living in an \"empty nest\" will depend on the parents' relationship with their children.\"If you're just waiting for them to leave home so you can get on with your life,then of course you'll be pleased to see them go,\" she said, \"But if you've built your life around your children you'll be terribly lonely.For some parents,their world falls apart when their children leave.\"",

According to the California Department of Public Health, these people were exposed to the illness at Disneyland from December 17-20.

There were 66 cases of measles reported in the state--23 of them in Orange County, where Disneyland is located. Measles spreads very easily. It can be caught from coughing and sneezing. Crowded areas like theme parks are especially suitable for its spread. The illness starts with a fever and develops into symptoms including a cough, runny nose, red eyes and so on. About three out of ten people infected with measles will develop another health problem, including an ear infection or pneumonia . The best way to _ measles is to get vaccinated .

What is a hybrid car? Any car that uses two or more sources of power is a hybrid car. Most hybrid cars on the road right now are petrol-electric hybrids. The petrol-electric hybrid car is just what it sounds like -- a cross between a petrol-powered car and an electric car. A gas-powered car has a fuel tank , which supplies petrol to the engine. An electric car, on the other hand, has a set of batteries that provides electricity for the car. To be useful to you or me, a car should be able to run at least 300 miles (483 km) before refueling, be capable of being refueled quickly and easily and fast enough to keep up with the other traffic on the road. A petrol car meets these requirements but produces a large amount of pollution. An electric car, however, produces almost no pollution, but can only go 50 to 100 miles (80 to 161 km) between recharging . And the problem has been that the electric car is very slow and inconvenient to recharge. A petrol-electric car combines the advantages of the two power sources into one system that uses both gas power and electric power. Some experts believe that the hybrid car is \"the next generation of smart cars\". A hybrid car can go up to 50% further than a traditional car can on the same amount of gas!

Apple's iPad Mini Release date: Nov 2,2012 (Wi-Fi version) Operating system: iOS 6 Size: 19.9 x 13.5 x 0.7 cm Prices: $329 (16GB Wi-Fi), $429 (32GB Wi-Fi), $519 (64GB Wi-Fi), or $459 (16GB Data) $559 (32GB Data), $659 (64GB Data) Google may have been forced to cancel its Android event in New York City on Oct 29 due to the threat of hurricane Sandy, but that isn't stopping it from making same big announcements. For starters, Google has confirmed that the Nexus 10 will be running Android 4.2 out of the box, so get excited. It will also come equipped with a 10-inch display running at an impressive 2560x1600 resolution. On the inside, it'll have a A15 dual-core processor running alongside 2GB of RAM ,so expect the Nexus 10 to be a speedy little tablet. Google's Nexus 10 Release date: Nov 13,2012 Operating system: Android 4.2 Jelly Bean Size: 26.4 x 17.8x0.9 cm Prices: $399 (16GB), $449 (32GB) Microsoft's Surface is a bold product with some great touches. It doesn't feature a camera and focuses on Office software, which suggests Microsoft is focusing this product on an executive toy. There's no 3G connection (only Wi-Fi) so owners won't have to worry about an extra contract. The real delight, however, is Metro, the impressive navigation interface .It is beautifully designed with brightly colored squares for navigation. Pre-orders for Surface in the US sold out over the weekend, so it would seem customers are excited. Microsoft's Surface Release date: Oct 26,2012 Operating system: Windows 8 RT Size: 27.5 x 17.2 x 0.9 cm Prices: $499 (32GB M-Fi)",

Many of these animals are not only expert climbers, but they also have found interesting ways to get from tree to tree. How Do Animals Adapt?andHow Do Animals Move? are comprehensive explorations of animal adaptations and movement for young readers. Both are part of a 21 book series,The Science of Living Things. InHow Do Animals Adapt?readers learn how animals adapt to survive with respect not only to climate, darkness, food and defenses but also to offspring and people. These adaptations are well explained in double page spreads with examples clearly depicted in photographs and diagrams and developed through their accompanying captions . As the title suggests, movement is the focus ofHow Do Animals Move?Beginning with a description of the explanation of movement, the reader is exposed to the many different ways of animals movement in the air, on land, under ground and in the water. Several unconventional variations (e.g. looping of inchworms, the rectilinear motion of snakes) are included. Once again, the photographs and diagrams plainly support the double page spread discussions of animal movement. The language of both titles is simple enough for young readers without talking down to them. In both books, terminology is featured in . Some of these words are explained in the basic glossary while the majority are explained clearly in the text. Many of these terms provide readers with some fascinating, uncommon words (e.g. brachiation, potassium, skein, and estimate). As do many of Kalman's book, both of these titles have a table of contents, glossary and index which are all enough to introduce young readers to the nature of these tools. Both titles would make excellent additions to any science collection for young readers.",

Cakes and sandwiches are brought in by footmen, yet you never see the Queen touch a thing. She simply sits beside a big silver plate, pouring cups of tea for everyone and carefully avoiding the cakes. At cocktail parties the Queen moves from group to group, chatting informally, and manages to make one glass of diet drink to last an entire evening. Tours abroad are difficult because hosts seem to believe the warmth of their welcome must be shown with wonderful state banquets . But the Queen has perfected the art of appearing to enjoy her meal without actually eating much. During one visit to the Pacific islands ofprefix = st1 /Tonga, a specially-prepared dinner was arranged in a hut made of wood and bamboo leaves. Deep holes were dug in the ground, filled with hot stones and baby pigs, and the pigs were slowly baked over several days. The Queen looked uneasily at her plate when she discovered a whole roast pig was her serving. Then she became uneasy when a turkey, some meat, bananas and an apple were also carried in for each guest. So she depended on her old favorite trick of talking with her host., King Tupou IV, carrying on a warm conversation. At the same time she pushed her food around her plate and only ate a piece of turkey and some fruit. Reporters traveling with her have noted that the Queen will sometimes seem so carried away by a foreign leader's political chat that she simply never has time to finish a meal before it is time to get up and make her speech. She will lift her fork to swallow a mouthful, then put it down again to make another point, leaving almost all of her meal untouched.",

          "context": "When I was 12, I got a part-time job on a dairy farm, milking cows. We milked 65 cows twice a day. One day, I complained to my father about having to go milk those cows, saying it was tiring. He said, you know, boy, to work is a blessing. I looked at the men who'd worked harder. I had a feeling I had been told something really important, but it took many years before it sank in. Back then, going to college was a rare privilege. My father told me if I'd picked something to study that I liked doing, I'd always look forward to my work. But he also added, even having a job you hate is better than not having a job at all. I wanted to be a farmer, but I joined a military program to help pay for college. And what started out as an obligation to the Army became a way of life that I had been devoted to for 37 years. In the late 1980s, during a visit to Bangladesh, I saw a woman with her baby on her back, breaking bricks with a hammer. I asked a local officer why they weren't using a machine to make the work easier. He told me a machine would put that lady out of work. And as bad as that woman's job was, it was enough to keep a small family alive. It reminded me of my father's words: to work is a blessing. After seeing a lot of people like that woman in Bangladesh, I've come to believe that people without jobs are not free. They're victims of crime, poor health, and depression. People who have jobs can have a home, send their kids to school, develop a sense of pride, contribute to the good of the community and even help others. When we can work, we are free.

          "context": "Everyone wants to know the secrets of a long and healthy life. Here are some discoveries from health experts. Many studies looking into the lives of centenarians look at what they eat. Many people who live into their hundreds live in the Mediterranean , so their diet, which is high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and healthy fats like olive oil, gets a lot of attention. The diet has been linked to a healthier older age, lower risk for heart disease, and even protection against memory loss. Education is related to a longer life. A 2012 report from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics found that people with a bachelor's degree or higher live about nine years longer than people who don't graduate high school. James Smith, a health economist at the RAND Corporation, is also a supporter of the argument for staying in school for better life expectancy. His findings show education should be an even bigger factor than race and income. Educated people are more likely to land better jobs, plan for their future, and make healthier lifestyle choices. Being a hard worker doesn't necessarily mean job-stress will harm you. The Longevity Study found that plenty of hard workers lived long lives. \"Skeptics may wonder if hard workers really are enjoying life.\" the authors write, \"We found that productive, hardworking people (even in old age) are not stressed or miserable, but tend to be happier, healthier, and more socially connected than their less productive peers.\" Having a strong social group is associated with a longer life. We often turn to friends and family for support, and taking care of the people that matter to us may help us take better care of ourselves, some evidence shows. Some research even suggests that immune function is improved when we are around our friends, and that they help with stress management. Research shows that sitting for long period of time put people at risk for shorter lifespans and other health risks. A 2011 study found that each hour people spent sitting down and watching TV after age 25 was linked to 22 minutes from their overall life expectancy.",

The 17-year-old girl defeated champion Serena Williams 6-1 6-4 in the Wimbledon final on Saturday in London to become the first Russian to win a single title at the championships. A silver lining to a depressing, rain-hit Wimbledon, she has raised heated passion. Nobody was complaining, though, for the 1.83-metre Sharapova has created a welcome wave of interest in tennis, something missing in recent years. Not even Anna Kournikova evoked such passion when she broke on to the scene. To look good on court is one thing, but Sharapova can actually play the game too. Extremely well. She proved it over 13 days at the world's most prestigious tournament. Playing tennis of the highest quality throughout, the Russian's triumph not only lifted the tournament from fits of rain-induced depression but also salvaged(;) the season for the woman's tour. Sharapova was given no easy ride in the tournament, having to beat 1999 champion Lindsay Davenport in the semifinals and twice-champion Serena Williams for the title. Neither caused her much concern. \"I don't remember too much about the final,\" Sharapova giggled. \"I was in my own place.\" She will find it increasingly hard to find any place to call her own from now on after advertisers identified her as the most marketable woman in sport. In Russia she is sensational news. She headlined the news bulletins and was telephoned by former Russian President Boris Yeltsin after her triumph. Sharapova will return to her adoptive Florida home knowing life will never be the same again. But the girl who arrived in the US aged seven with her father and just US$700 is determined not to let fame and riches detract from her number one love, tennis. \"I know things will start coming up and that many more things will want to get involved, but I want to keep my head cool and play tennis,\" she said.",

If you are afraid you don't discipline your children enough,the evidence of parental failure is right there in front of everyone. The child is not filling out her college applications ! lf you are afraid that you have allowed your children to watch too much television and settle for low grades,you will have to answer for the consequences. The over-involvement of many parents in the process is,from my perspective,a cover for this deep parental anxiety: Did I do a good job with this child? Did I do everything I needed to do for this child? Is this child going to have a good life? I have seen manv parents,dive back into their children's lives at college admission time, trying to fill all of their wisdom and discipline into their children at the last moment. Parents may need to be sure as their children leave the nest that they reall} have taught them how to fly. Since it is impossible to assess the quality of what parents have done for their children at this point,the next best thing is the status of the colege to which the child is admitted. From the point of an anxious parent,an \"Ivy l,eague college\" child is proof of better child rearing than a \"small college\" child. I once sat with a talented,weak senior girl and her brilliant parents. She,they,and the school had to decide whether she should remam m school or go into a hospital. In light of her anorexia( ) ,the school recommended strongly that she not file her early application to Princeton. Upon hearing this,the girl looked at the adults in the room and said,\"If I can't apply early to Princeton,l'll die. \" Her parents were also eager to have her get into Princeton. Why did they all need this so desperately? Because,in this case,something was wrong in the family. Due to some weakness in her upbringing,this child was not happy or self-confident. Yet she was eighteen,the culture required her to leave home. The psychological solution for them all was the comforting vision of a great college. Somehow going there would make her life fine and defend her parents' child rearing. Such fears about letting go of an unfmished child exist in all families. How can we let go of a child who is still so young in so many ways? It is painful and has no cure except time and hope. For parents looking for a painkiller,the college admission process is where they can work out their anxieties.",

Social scientists have long tried to determine why some children grow up to be successful.In a 2001 study, Greg Duncan, a professor of education at the University of California, measured the influence that the people in a child's life have on how well the child does in school.Duncan and his team found almost no relationship between how students did on the test and whom they sat beside in class, whom they hung out with after school and who lived in their block.The only meaningful link they found was between siblings and twins in particular. For a long time, scholars thought that a family's income heavily affected how well kids did in life.But that might not be the case.When Susan Mayer at the University of Chicago looked at the relationship between family income and lifetime achievement, she ran a series of experiments to measure it, finding such outcomes weren't caused by income.She argued that the things that make a difference are relatively inexpensive: the number of books a kid has or how often his family goes to museums. Lareau, another scholar began one of the most in-depth observations of American parenting.He concluded that success is much more related to the amount of time parents spend with their children.He said \"Many parents I interviewed are anxious about their children's futures.But they have exaggerated the sense of the risks involved if they don't give their children 'the best' of everything.\" So at last, we decided to leave things as it were.More time with our kid is the best we can provide.",

At the start of the year, the pupils were each given a _ , ranging from \"excellent prospect\" to \"unlikely to do well\". These were totally untrue ratings and did not reflect how well the pupils had previously performed. However, these ratings were given to the teachers. At the end of the year, the experimenters compared the pupils' performance with the ratings. Despite their real abilities, there was an astonishingly high connection between performance and ratings. It seems that people perform as well as we expect them to. The Self-fulfilling Effect is also known as the Pygmalion Effect. This comes from an old Greek story. The story was also the basis of George Bernard Shaw's play \"Pygmalion\", later turned into the musical \"My Fair Lady\". In Shaw's play, Professor Henry Higgins claims he can turn a Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle into a duchess. But, as Eliza herself points out to Higgins' friend Pickering, it isn't what she learns or does that determines whether she will become a duchess, but how she's treated. The implication of the Pygmalion Effect for leaders and managers is massive. It means that the performance of your team depends less on them than it does on you. The performance you get from people is no more or less than what you expect, which means you must always expect the best. As Goethe said, \"Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is. Treat a man as he can and should be and he will become as he can and should be.\"",

          "context": "You must have been troubled by when to say \"I love you\" because it is one of the greatest puzzles in our life. What if you say it first and your partner doesn't love you back? Or if they do say it but you don't feel they mean it? Being the first to declare your love can be never racking and risky and can leave you feeling as vulnerable as a turtle with no shell. But is the person who says it first really in a position of weakness? Doesn't it pay to hold back, play it cool and wait until the other half has shown their hand faster? \"A really good relationship should be about being fair and being equal,\" says psychologist Sidney Crown. \"But love is seldom equal.\" \"All relationships go through power struggles but,\" he says, \"if a love imbalance continues for years, the rot will set in.\" That feeling of \"I've always loved you more\" may be subverted (,) for a time, but it never goes away completely and it often emerges in squabbling . In love, at least, the silent, withholding type is not always the most powerful. \"The strongest one in a relationship is often the person who feels confident enough to talk about their feelings,\" says educational psychologist Ingrid Collins. Psychosexual therapist Paula Hall agrees. \"The one with the upper hand is often the person who takes the initiative.\" In fact, the person who says \"I love you\" first may also be the one who says \"I'm bored with you' first.\" Hall believes that much depends on how \"I love you\" is said and the motivation of the person saying it. Is it said when they're drunk? Is it said before their partner flies off on holiday, and what it really means is \"Please don' t be unfaithful to me\" ? By saying \"I love you\", they are really saying \"Do you love me?\" If so, wouldn't it just be more honest to say that. Collins agrees that intention is everything. \"It's not what is said, but how it's said. What it comes down to is the sincerity of the speaker.\"",

But there was no pen or paper in the village, because no one could read or write. The doctor picked up a piece of burnt wood from the fire. Using the wood, he wrote the name of the medicine on the door of the house. \"Get this medicine for him,\" he said,\"and he will soon get better.\" Marek's family and friends did not know what to do. They could not read the strange writing. Then the village baker had an idea. He took off the door of the house, put it on his cart and drove to the nearest town.

You may be wondering why you should study abroad. Here are some answers for you. * Timing The absolutely best time in your life to study abroad is when you are in college. If you miss this opportunity, it's almost impossible for you to do it later in life. * To gain cross-cultural experience Life overseas makes you see your everyday world in a whole new light. You don't even realize it, but our culture shapes the way we view the world and affects us every minute of the day. Differences in culture are more than just differences in language, food, clothing and art. * To improve your communication skills and your self-confidence People who study abroad tend to be willing to take risks, willing to put themselves in unusual situations, and able to solve problems. * To become more fluent in a language or to learn a new language The world market is becoming smaller, and many companies require a second language. Foreign languages are not only valuable in the job market but also valuable in the real world. * For the adventure Travel to other cities within your host country and around neighboring countries. As you get to know your new classmates, roommates, and host family, you will gain a unique view on the host culture. Discover the differences and, more importantly, the many similarities between your worlds. The friendships you make will last long after the program. * To learn more about yourself Find out who you really are. What are your limits? How do you overcome the difficulties you've never _ before? How independent are you? These questions are hard to answer until you are removed from your usual surroundings. After solving difficult problems on your own overseas, you'll find that almost nothing will confuse you at home. Students who study abroad commonly report that their study abroad experience actually changed their lives.",

The London 2012 Organising Committee (Locog) confirmed on Wednesday that an error n its ticket selling had led to four synchronised swimming competitions being oversold by 10, 000 tickets. Locog and its ticket agent spent the Christmas period contacting ticket holders and offering them alternatives that included the tickets they had applied for but unsuccessful.The hanges need no additional cost.It has also offered to return any discrepancy if the n ew tickets cost less than the originals.Locog said the replacement tickets would come from a number of unsold seats across the Olympic Games and _ was doing all it could to make up the error to the fans who bought tickets. Locog said the error occurred in the summer, between the first and second round of ticket sales, when a member of staff made a mistake, entering \"20,000\" into the computer rather than the correct figure of 10,000 remaining tickets.The error was discovered when Locog checked the number of tickets that had been sold against the final seating numbers, and began contacting ticket holders before Christmas. Thousands of ticket holders have already struck lucky, changing to tickets for major events including swimming and athletics finals, and in around 200 cases the hottest of all, the men's 100m final.Locog said the decision to award 100m final tickets was made because one of the synchronised swimming competitions was on the same afternoon as the event, August 5.",

          "context": "Five or six years ago, I attended a lecture on the science of attention. A professor who conducts research over in the medical school was talking about attention blindness, the basic feature of the human brain that, when we concentrate on one task, causes us to miss just about everything else. Because we can't see what we can't see, our lecturer was determined to catch us in the act. He had us watch a video of six people tossing basketballs back and forth, three in white shirts and three in black, and our task was to keep track only of the tosses among the people in white. The tape rolled, and everyone began counting. Everyone except me. I'm dyslexic , and the moment I saw that tape with the confusing basketball tossers, I knew I wouldn't be able to keep track of their movements, so I let my mind wander. I became curious, though, when about 30 seconds into the tape, a gorilla walked in among the players. She (we later learned a female student was in the gorilla suit) stared at the camera, beat her chest with her fist, and then went away while they continued passing the balls. When the tape stopped, the professor asked how many people had counted at least a dozen basketball tosses. Hands went up all over. He then asked who had counted 13, 14, and congratulated those who'd scored the perfect 15. Then he asked, \"And who saw the gorilla?\" I raised my hand and was surprised to discover I was the only person at my table and one of only three or four in the large room to do so. He'd set us up, trapping us in our own attention blindness. Yes, there had been a trick, but he wasn't the one who had played it on us. By concentrating so hard on counting, we had managed to miss the gorilla in the midst. Attention blindness is the fundamental organizing principle of the brain, and I believe that it presents us with a great opportunity. My take is different from that of many neuroscientists: Where they see the shortcomings of the individual, I sense an opportunity for cooperation. Fortunately, given the interactive nature of most of our lives in the digital age, we have the tools to control our different forms of attention and take advantage of them. It's not easy to admit that everything we've learned about how to pay attention means that we've been missing everything else. It's not easy for us logical, intelligent, confident types to admit that the very key to our success -- our ability to discover a problem and solve it, an achievement obtained in all those years in school and beyond -- may be exactly what limits us. No one ever told us that our way of seeing left out everything else.",

With lower-quality lenses and image sensors, smartphones probably won't replace professional video cameras anytime soon. Still, some creative filmmakers are extending the borders of smartphone moviemaking by shooting professional-quality films using only smartphones. Soon after Apple's iPhone 4 was released, two filmmakers decided to make a short film using only their iPhone 4s. Michael Koerbel and Anna Elizabeth James shot and edited the one-and-a-half-minute film Apple of My Eye in only 48 hours. Audiences were fascinated with the film, in which a man and his grandfather connect emotionally while admiring a model train set in a store window. The filmmakers followed up their success with Goldilocks, an extraordinary spy novel told over nine, three-minute films. Many filmmakers are convinced that smartphone films are here to stay. One sign is their inclusion in major film festivals. In February 2012, organizers of the Berkshire International Film Festival staged the 10 X 10 On North Festival. Entries included Oliver by Hooman Khalili, an award-winning film about a girl whose special powers enable her to brighten the lives of three lonely people. Another entry was Yearlapse'11, a 365-second film by Zsolt Haraszti that describes an actual journey he made from New York to London. During the festival, which ran from February 16 to 26, these and many other smartphone films were shown at the Beacon Cinema in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Similar festivals in Canada and South Korea have given smartphone filmmakers opportunities to show off their creative work.",

TransLink chief executive officer Peter Strachan said bus and train services were continuing to run where possible, however all CityCat and CityFerry services had been cancelled until further notice. \"These are extremely difficult conditions for South East Queensland---we are running essential services where possible but safety remains to be the most important,\" Mr Strachan said. \"Severe weather and associated flooding has impacted on all modes of public transport, with bus, ferry and train services all impacted to varying degrees. \"If you are planning to use public transport at anytime over the next few days, then I would recommend you check that your intended service is still running.\" Service disruptions for today include: l City network trains running hourly on all lines. l Bus diversions, delays and cancellations in some regions, particularly across Brisbane, Ipswich and the Sunshine Coast. l CityCat and CityFerry services cancelled. Queensland Rail Chief Executive Officer Paul Scurrah said rising waterways had closed some train lines, and road closures and damage to property throughout the South-East had contributed to a shortage of available rail employees. \"We intend to run trains hourly on all lines, similar to the timetable we operate on Christmas Day. We will also be looking to run other additional services to meet demand as required. At this stage we will run services stopping at all stations which will depart at the same time on the hour, however, this is all subject to the weather conditions and the availability of traincrew.\" Mr Scurrah encouraged all customers to visit the Translink website for specific departure times for their station, and asked for patience in the event of delays. \"Queensland Rail appreciates that reduced services may cause disruptions but it is simply unavoidable. We have a dedicated and experienced team monitoring the situation around the clock and will be working to reopen the network as soon as practicably possible,\" Mr Scurrah said. The latest service disruption information is available on the TransLink website www.translink.com.au.",

          "context": "Is it time to kick Russia out of the BRICs ?If so, it may end up sounding like a famous ball-point pen maker--BIC. An argument is being made that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device , the BRICs, should really be the BICs. \"Is Russia really worth the name BRICs?\" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreign Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of \"The Russian Balance Sheet\", thinks the Russia of Putin and Medvedev is just not worthy of inclusion alongside Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic powerhouses. He writes: \"The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one must ask whether it has any say at all on the global economy, compared with the other members of its group. I have just returned from Moscow, which is always dull around this season. For the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state has been living on oil and gas.\" Economically, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund figures that the Russian economy will fall by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There is less of a case for Brazil, with a fall of 0.7 percent, but it is still doing far better than Russia. But the BRICs are not just about economy. As is mentioned above, it is a marketing device to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment standpoint, it could be argued that Russia is leading the BRICs. Its stock market is up 128 percent this year while around 80 percent is for the other three. At very least, despite Russia's economic underperformance, its stock market outperformance does suggest it is indeed one of the group.",

But experts are now warning that the current shoe fashions will be causing teenagers discomfort in the short term and storing up years of foot, knee and back pain in the future. Here, the experts identify the problems caused by teenagers' shoe choice. KEDS/VANS Slip-on shoes with elastic sides are particularly popular among teenage boys-with Keds and Vans the most sought-after brands. The main problem is that they are just too flat--so flat that the heel, which strikes the ground first, also becomes damaged and painful. BALLET PUMPS The worst shoes of all are such light and thin dolly shoes. The problem is partly their flatness, as with Keds and Vans. However ballet pumps, which have no string or heel, have other specific problems. \"As the shoe has no fastening device, it relies on the toes to keep the shoe on, causing an awkward gait ,this leads to short-and long-term problems such as calluses ,heel and knee pain.\" WEDGES AND STILETTOS These shoes can also cause problems with gait, They may look good, but the heels on these are so high they can force the wearer's body weight forward, making them very unstable. Teens who wear these shoes regularly are also in danger of joining those millions of women with constant back pain. SCHOOL SHOES So what do podiatrists have on their wish list, especially for everyday wear? Something in a natural, breathable fabric, with a string to hold it on, with a small heel and a deep toe-box that does not press the toes, such as Clark's, Marks & Spencer or Rhino. If your teen insists on wearing 'bad' shoes, get them some simple foot orthotics in the shoes. These support and correct the movement of the foot and, properly fitted by a podiatrist, can often transform their walk and halt the damage.",

The typical classroom used to be the place where teachers and students were working and exploring the wonderful world of knowledge together, but now everything has changed. The Internet is one of those approaches. Learning via the Internet is a new style that seems to become successful than the traditional teaching. The Internet provides schools with a large amount of learning material that is accessible to students online. Owing to the choices of courses online, completing a program becomes much easier. We used to go to the library when we needed information and spend hours searching for the right sources. Today there is a \"library\" in our house and it is available 24 hours a day. From my personal experience, being a first time mother, I find that using information online is very helpful. While I am at home with my baby, I can still search for the material I need and exchange thoughts and information with my classmates without leaving my house. The Internet is not only a big information provider but also a money and time saver. People predict that education will be much cheaper in the future because of Internet access to information. The cost of land, building and wages for teachers are continuously increasing. In addition, regular courses (offline) depend heavily on books and other paper-based materials, while online education posts lectures, and assignments electronically, which saves thousands of dollars every year. With no physical restrictions, the Internet classes and courses are also very convenient. In classroom-based education there is a limitation on the number of students while Internet education is available to everyone. Students don't have to struggle in order to register for classes they like. Students will have more choices to take their courses and classes online. The Internet offers a wonderful opportunity to obtain knowledge in a more convenient and less expensive way. In my opinion, online life in the future is simply inescapable.",

A white light flashed and lit the sky in silver. It flashed again and was followed by rapid sharp sounds of gunfire. \"They're hunting ducks.\" Ali said in a hoarse voice. \"They hunt ducks at night, you know.\" Don't be afraid. A siren went off in the distance. Somewhere glass broke and someone shouted. I heard people on the street, jolted from sleep and probably still in their pajamas, with ruffled hair and puffy eyes. Hassan was crying. Ali pulled him close, clutched him with tenderness. We stayed huddled that way until the early hours of the morning. The shootings and explosions had lasted less than an hour, but they had frightened us badly, because none of us had ever heard gunshots in the streets. They were foreign sounds to us then. The generation of Afghan children whose ears would know nothing but the sounds of bombs and gunfire was not yet born. Huddled together in the dining room and waiting for the sun to rise, none of us had any notion that a way of life had ended. The end came when Russian tanks were rolling into the very same streets where Hassan and I played, bringing the death of the Afghanistan I knew and marking the start of a still ongoing era of bloodletting. Just before sunrise, Baba's car peeled into the driveway. His door slammed shut and his running footsteps pounded the stairs. Then he appeared in the doorway and I saw something on his face. Something I didn't recognize right away because I'd never seen it before: fear. \"Amir! Hassan!\" He cried as he ran to us, opening his arms wide. \"They blocked all the roads and the telephone didn't work.

Unfortunately, I am not good at any sport of any kind, let alone parachute jumping. My friend Mr. Smith was willing to give me a hand. He took me to a ground school. The first day's training included several hours of instruction but not my first drop from an airplane. For this, I had to wait until the following morning. The next morning, after a hurried, anxious breakfast, I was taken to the airfield. There, two heavy parachutes were put on my back. Then I was asked to make my way to a small plane which had just stopped slowly on the runway. Once on the plane, it was soon climbing. I began to feel nervous. As we reached one thousand meters, Harry, my teacher, hooked a line from my parachute to a steel ring inside the plane. The line was to pull my parachute open after I jumped. \"Get ready, Henry,\" Harry said. I moved carefully to the door. I wanted to cry, \"No, no, no!\" but no word came. \"Jump!\" Harry called out loudly. \"Jump!\" To my surprise, kicking like a frog, I did jump. Away from the plane, and down, down I fell. It worked! The air seemed to hold me up. I was very happy. Then I felt a quick pull. My big parachute had opened! It was like the best surprise I'd ever had. I looked down. There were rivers, trees, fields and houses. I heard the soft sound of the air. This was fun!",

There are states where the white man imposes his rule by force; there are states where the black man protests by setting fire to cities and by looting and pillaging. Important people on both sides, who would in other respects appear to be reasonable men, get up and calmly argue in favor of violence - as if it were a legitimate solution, like any other. What is really frightening, what really fills you with despair, is the realization that when it comes to the crunch, we have made no actual progress at all. We may wear collars and ties instead of war-paint, but our instincts remain basically unchanged. The whole of the recorded history of the human race, that tedious documentation of violence, has taught us absolutely nothing. We have still not learnt that violence never solves a problem but makes it more serious. The sheer horror, the bloodshed, the suffering mean nothing. No solution ever comes to light the morning after when we dismally contemplate the smoking ruins and wonder what hit us. The truly reasonable men who know where the solutions lie are finding it harder and harder to get a hearing. They are despised, mistrusted and even persecuted by their own kind because they advocate such apparently outrageous things as law enforcement. If half the energy that goes into violent acts were put to good use, if our efforts were directed at cleaning up the shabby houses at improving living-standards and providing education and employment for all, we would have gone a long way to arriving at a solution. Our strength is weakened by having to mop up the mess that violence leaves in its wake. In a well-directed effort, it would not be impossible to fulfill the ideals of a stable social programme. The benefits that can be derived from constructive solutions are everywhere apparent in the world around us. Genuine and lasting solutions are always possible, providing we work within the framework of the law. Before we can even begin to reflect on peaceful co-existence between the races, we must appreciate each other's problems. And to do this, we must learn about them: it is a simple exercise in communication, in exchanging information. \"Talk, talk, talk,\" the advocates of violence say, \"all you ever do is talk, and we are none the wiser.\" It's rather like the story of the famous lawyer who carefully explained his case to the judge. After listening to a lengthy argument the judge complained that after all this talk, he was none the wiser. \"Possible, my lord,\" the lawyer replied, \"none the wiser, but surely far better informed.\" Knowledge is the necessary prerequisite to wisdom: the knowledge that violence creates the evils it pretends to solve.",

The kings of those days presented a white elephant to the people they wanted to ruin. Once they received this holy, royal animal as a gift, they were not allowed to sell or kill it.

Sure enough, the Chevy Nova never went anywhere in Latin America. Translation problems Sometimes it is the slogan that doesn't work. No company knows this better than Pepsi-Cola, with its \"Come alive with Pepsi!\" campaign. The campaign was so successful in the United States , Pepsi translated its slogan literally for its international campaign. As it turned out , the translations weren't quite right. Pepsi was begging Germans to \"Come out of the grave \" and telling the Chinese that \"Pepsi brings your ancestors back from the grave.\" A picture's worth a thousand words Other times, the problem involves packaging . A picture of a smiling baby has helped sell countless jars of Gerber baby food. When Gerber started selling baby food in Africa, they used the same packaging as in the US, with the smiling baby on the label. Later they learned that in African countries, the picture on the jar shows what the jar has in it, for many people there can't read.
