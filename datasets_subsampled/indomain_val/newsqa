However, only about one-third of people with the intestinal disorder seek treatment.\n\n\n\nThe exact cause of IBS remains unknown, and that lack of knowledge has led to the use of a variety of treatments, including fiber supplements, probiotics, antidepressants, behavioral-based therapies, psychotherapy, food modification, acupuncture, and laxatives. However, many treatments are controversial because study results have been mixed.\n\n\n\nNewer and more expensive medications have been introduced to the public, but some were ineffective or withdrawn from the market due to side effects. The recent study sheds light on the cheap and readily available treatments that can help patients, says study coauthor Eamonn M. Quigley, M.D., a professor of medicine and physiology at University College Cork in Ireland.\n\n\n\n\"Medical science has tended to ignore IBS; it wasn't appreciated how much of an impact it can have on a patient's quality of life,\" he says. Health.com: Is that belly ache in your head?\n\n\n\nIn the new analysis, researchers systematically reviewed 38 studies from the last 25 years; more than 2,500 volunteers were involved. That research compared therapies -- all relatively cheap, safe, and readily available -- with a placebo or with no treatment at all.\n\n\n\nThe team looked at three treatments -- soluble fiber, peppermint oil, and antispasmodics, which are drugs that relax the smooth muscle in the gut and relieve cramping -- and found that they were all more effective than a placebo, according to the report in the British Medical Journal.\n\n\n\nBut not all fiber is the same. The soluble fiber ispaghula husk, which is also known as psyllium and found in some bulk laxatives, significantly reduced symptoms of  IBS, particularly constipation; insoluble fiber, such as bran, did not relieve symptoms.\n\n\n\nSeveral antispasmodic drugs helped prevent IBS symptoms, particularly diarrhea. The most effective one was hyoscine, which is sold without a prescription in the United States.\n\n\n\nAlthough peppermint oil was found to be the most effective of the three therapies, more data are needed, cautions Quigley. The peppermint-oil therapy was analyzed in only four trials involving 392 patients.\n\n\n\nBecause past research has been mixed, doctors' treatment guidelines mention the remedies, but don't necessarily give them a ringing endorsement, says author Alex Ford, M.D., a registrar of gastroenterology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\n\n\n\"I suspect that filters down to the practitioners who don't believe they work, so they try something that's newer or a bit sexier,\" Dr. Ford says. \"The problem with IBS is that it's a chronic medical condition and no drug has been shown to alter its natural history.\" Health.com: Should I be tested for IBS?\n\n\n\nThe study results are not surprising, says Joanne A.P.

Superman defeats the Ku Klux Klan\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 1940s, \"The Adventures of Superman\" was a radio sensation. Kids across the country huddled around their sets as the Man of Steel leapt off the page and over the airwaves. Although Superman had been fighting crime in print since 1938, the weekly audio episodes fleshed out his storyline even further.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was on the radio that Superman first faced kryptonite, met The Daily Planet reporter Jimmy Olsen, and became associated with \"truth, justice, and the American way.\" So, it's no wonder that when a young writer and activist named Stetson Kennedy decided to expose the secrets of the Ku Klux Klan, he looked to a certain superhero for inspiration.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the post-World War II era, the Klan experienced a huge resurgence. Its membership was skyrocketing, and its political influence was increasing, so Kennedy went undercover to infiltrate the group. By regularly attending meetings, he became privy to the organization's secrets.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when he took the information to local authorities, they had little interest in using it. The Klan had become so powerful and intimidating that police were hesitant to build a case against them.\n\n\n\n\n\nStruggling to make use of his findings, Kennedy approached the writers of the Superman radio serial.

The KKK was a great fit for the role.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 16-episode series titled \"Clan of the Fiery Cross,\" the writers pitted the Man of Steel against the men in white hoods. As the storyline progressed, the shows exposed many of the KKK's most guarded secrets.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy revealing everything from code words to rituals, the program completely stripped the Klan of its mystique.

The findings are published in the February 27 issue of the journal Science and were partially funded by the ALS Association.\n\n\n\nALS, a disease of the nervous system, impairs muscle movement and eventually results in total paralysis. It was brought to national attention in 1939, when famed Yankee baseball player Lou Gehrig's illness was diagnosed as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. Today, the disease is most commonly known by his name.\n\n\n\nALS6 is a protein normally found inside a cell's nucleus, but in patients with Lou Gehrig's disease, it is found outside the nucleus and sometimes forms unusual clumps.\n\n\n\nALS researchers are unsure why this occurs but believe this finding, combined with a gene they discovered last year, TDP-43, may lead them to a firmer idea of what causes this deadly disease.\n\n\n\nBoth genes help in building and transporting proteins and making sure they're in the right place in cell structure -- a process called RNA processing.\n\n\n\nLucie Bruijn, senior vice president of research and development at the ALS Association, likens this process to building an engine: If there are parts missing or placed in the wrong place or in the wrong way, the engine doesn't work right.\n\n\n\n\"Everything has an exquisite role and has to be in the right place, and any imbalance ... can cause things to go awry,\" Bruijn said.\n\n\n\n\"It's exciting because what it's starting to tell us now is that we might be starting to get an underlying theme,\" Bruijn said. \"We now have two genes with similar function strengthening the idea that alterations in RNA processing is important in ALS. A completely new direction and also involved in many other neurodegenerative diseases.\"\n\n\n\nShe believes this gives researchers \"huge\" potential to develop new therapies.\n\n\n\nAnd new therapies are needed.\n\n\n\nThere is no cure and only one treatment for ALS, a neurodegenerative disease that seems to progressively attack the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. These attacks can cause symptoms such as muscle weakness, twitching, cramping and thick speech, eventually leading to paralysis. According to the ALS Association, the disease strikes a little more than 5,600 people every year, and about 10 percent of those cases are hereditary.\n\n\n\nThe discovery of this new gene mutation will also allow those with ALS in their family to be tested for another gene (this makes three genes).

The components of her disease had not yet been placed together, indicating that this was a new form of illness.\n\n\n\nOther cases spread in following years around Africa and in homosexual men in New York and San Francisco. By 1980, 55 American men had been diagnosed with the disease. Research began in Europe, the U.S. and Africa to ascertain what this new disease could be.\n\n\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control found that the disease was caused by a virus being passed around by bodily fluids such as semen or blood. In 1981 it published its findings, saying the disease attacked T-cells, which help the body fight infection.\n\n\n\nBy 1983 the disease was isolated by teams of American and French researchers. In 1986 an international committee decided the virus should be called human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n\n\n\nEducation campaigns were unrolled around the world, advising people to avoid risky sexual behavior or sharing needles.\n\n\n\nBy June 1990, 139,765 people had the disease, with a 60 per cent mortality rate. The progress of the disease slowed down in the West with education campaigns and the development of protease inhibitors, which provided sufferers with almost complete remission. But in Africa, the spread and treatment of HIV remains a global concern.\n\n\n\nTHE DISCOVERY OF LITHIUM TO TREAT MOOD DISORDERS\n\n\n\nAustralian psychiatrist John Frederick Joseph Cade once said, \"I believe the brain, like any other organ, can get sick and it can also heal.\"\n\n\n\nHe made huge gains in healing the brain through his work with sufferers of bipolar disorder by discovering that lithium salts -- a naturally occurring chemical - could be used to treat the illness.\n\n\n\nPreviously, electro-convulsive therapy and lobotomies had been the major treatments for bipolar disorder.\n\n\n\nAfter having been a prisoner of war in World War II, Dr. Cade served as the head of the Bundoora Repatriation Hospital in Melbourne Australia. It was at an unused kitchen in Bundoora where he conducted crude experiments that led to the discovery of lithium as a treatment of bipolar disorder. After trials on humans, Dr. Cade speculated that bipolar disorder was a \"lithium deficiency disease\" and that a dose of lithium had a calming effect.\n\n\n\nDr. Cade published findings in the Medical Journal of Australia in 1949 entitled \"Lithium salts in the treatment of psychotic excitement.\"\n\n\n\nHe died in 1980.

The pilots will be grounded until they can demonstrate they have been stable for a year, although those who can prove a history of successful medical treatment should be able to fly \"within a few months,\" the FAA said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new policy will \"absolutely\" improve safety, said Randy Babbitt, head of the FAA and a former airline pilot and union chief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The concern that we have today is we have people who are either self-medicating or not seeking a diagnosis. Either of those is unacceptable,\" Babbitt said. \"This change ... will allow those people to get the treatment, allow us to monitor and return them to the cockpit [as] safer, better pilots.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA officials said that they do not know the extent of depression among pilots but that pilots are probably representative of the larger population, in which 10 percent are believed to suffer from depression.\n\n\n\n\n\nNor does the FAA know how many pilots have removed themselves from flying status because they suffer from depression, a condition that now bars them from flying. Nor do they know how many take antidepressants in violation of FAA policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercial pilots under the age of 40 are required to undergo a medical exam by an FAA-certified physician every year; those over 40, every six months. But the examination focuses largely on the pilots' physical health, and there is no formal assessment of the pilots' mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FAA says pilots have a regulatory duty and professional responsibility to not fly if they know they have a physical or mental condition that makes them unsafe to fly.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the FAA concedes pilots aren't always forthcoming, especially if honesty could cost them their job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that there are people out there who are not taking antidepressants because they know they would be grounded if they are. We know there are people out there who are taking them and lying to us about that,\" said Dr. Fred Tilton, the FAA's federal air surgeon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We think it's safer to [make sure pilots are treated for depression] than to continue to drive it underground,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the new policy, the FAA will, on a case-by-case basis, issue special medical certificates to pilots who take one of four antidepressants: fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa) and escitalopram (Lexapro).\n\n\n\n\n\nAll four drugs can be used safely without side effects, the FAA said, and other medications will be considered as the agency gains experience and data under its new policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA officials say that they have been studying the issue for a decade, and that the change comes with improvements in medication and as the stigma of depression has diminished.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the concerns is the risk of suicide by airplane.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween 1993 and 2002, there were 16 \"aircraft-assisted suicides,\" according to a National Transportation Safety Board report, as recounted in a recent FAA medical bulletin. All involved smaller aircraft.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the NTSB ruled that in 1999, the pilot caused the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 by forcing the plane into the Atlantic Ocean, although the board could not determine the pilot's motives and did not use the term \"suicide.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pilot's medical certificate had been renewed 10 days before the crash. All 217 on board were killed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Depression is a disease, and it's treatable just like any other disease.

Yup. Our bard would be the internet, breeding ground of such gems as \"BRB,\" \"tweet,\" and, sadly, \"OMG!!!!!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSome may call the advent of internet-speak the demise of the English language, and to them we would say, \"STFU.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, \"unfriend\" was deemed the word of the year by the Oxford American Dictionary. So, much like that tattoo of your initials you got emblazoned across your butt last summer after too many G&Ts, this new slang is here to stay.\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides, Shakespeare coined the word \"puke,\" so it wasn't all sunshine and roses back in the 1500s, anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, there are some internet terms that don't quite translate when applied to real-life situations (or, OK, any situation other than the original and intended one), because they're too obtuse, redundant or just plain stupid.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's our take on three of the most awkward phrases and symbols to go from screen to scene:\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\n\n\n\nAh, the hashtag. First introduced into the Twitter lexicon by Chris Messina in 2007, the hashtag was originally a way to tie together common threads of conversation (e.g., Follow Friday, tweets relating to events, news about natural disasters).\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, however, the hashtag has also become a way in which to emphasize certain ideas on the microblogging site (\"This weekend has completely murdered my soul #whiskeyandheartache), and, more recently, to denote sarcasm and caustic wit (\"Wow, I really enjoyed that show. Etch-a-Sketch art is totally dope. More free wine, however, would have made the experience much more tolerable. #JustSayin').\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's all well and good in the Twitterverse, but when taken into the real world, the hashtag is a bit harder to hash out.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou see, the majority of society -- you know, the people who don't sit in front of their computers tweeting about how \"Eating pancakes makes me feel like death now that I'm 30 #notakidanymore\" -- doesn't understand what the hell you're saying when you tack what amounts to a pound sign onto any given sentence/word in your correspondence (e-mails, etc.). In fact, they could get offended by what you think is an artfully punctuated joke.\n\n\n\n\n\nListen, we do not yet have a symbol that translates into sarcasm (despite lofty efforts by the folks over at Sarcmark), and the hashtag is no exception. So, for now, stick to being caustic and dry, and even then, watch your mouth. Not everyone is socially fluent enough to recognize superior wit when they see it. #JustSayin'...\n\n\n\n\n\n@\n\n\n\n\n\nMoMA's Department of Architecture and Design may have added the \"@\" sign to its collection in March, but the artfully looping symbol has yet to find any real foothold in the conversational realm.\n\n\n\n\n\nLook, it makes sense to add an @ to your name on Twitter, and Facebook now has a handy tagging feature that works with the addition of that particular keystroke, but referring to your friends as \"@Tom\" or \"@T-Bone\" in digital parlance such as e-mail or chat is just ... well ... redundant.

The man was refused citizenship because he was depriving his wife of the liberty to come and go with her face uncovered, Besson said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decision, made Tuesday, came exactly a week after a French parliamentary commission recommended a partial ban on any veils that cover the face -- including the burqa, the full-body covering worn by some Muslim women.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ban -- which has not yet come up for a vote -- would apply in public places like hospitals and schools, and on public transport, the commission announced.\n\n\n\n\n\nForeigners may become French citizens if they marry French nationals and meet certain criteria, including integrating well in French society and having \"good morality,\" Besson said. It is on the criteria of morality that the man's citizenship request was denied, Besson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This individual imposes the full veil upon his wife, does not allow her the freedom to go and come as she pleases, and bans her from going out with her face unveiled, and rejects the principles of secularism and equality between man and woman,\" Besson said he told President Nicolas Sarkozy.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrance's top court denied a Moroccan woman's naturalization request in 2008 on the grounds that she wore a burqa.\n\n\n\n\n\nSarkozy controversially told lawmakers six months ago that the traditional Muslim burqa was \"not welcome\" in France.

But, overall this produces much higher insurance rates for all drivers.\n\n\n\nCar companies and insurers are working hard to try and reduce the cost of auto repairs and insurance premiums for consumers and some of the development is breathtaking in its innovation\n\n\n\nThis effort has already led to many new developments in the design of various auto parts and components -- which have indeed led to a reduction in repair costs for various auto parts, components and structures.\n\n\n\nAnd more advances are on the way: some carmakers have recently ramped up their operations in this area, which should result in greater cost savings in coming years.\n\n\n\nOne recent development in this area is the Ford Motor Company's new $650,000 Paint and Body Technology Center in Inkster, Michigan, about 20 minutes from the company's Dearborn world headquarters. The new center was created by merging operations with the company's Safety Crash Test Analysis department.\n\n\n\nOther car companies have their own versions of this kind of operation, including Ford's crosstown rivals, General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC.\n\n\n\nThe new Ford center represents an advancement over its previous paint and body tech operation in that it's larger, closer to the company's HQ, and now works more closely with design engineers and auto insurers -- and gets insurers involved earlier in the design process. AOL Autos: Cut your insurance in half\n\n\n\nThe goal is to identify potential repair issues and then use that info to refine designs -- which in turn helps cut the cost of repairs at dealerships and independent repair shops. Plus, this effort allows repair techs to more effectively restore the vehicles to their pre-accident condition.\n\n\n\nTo that end, engineers gather data earlier in the vehicle development process so it can be then analyzed during crash and durability testing. AOL Autos: How to choose a repair shop\n\n\n\nFor Ford, the closer integration of these functions began when the carmaker's repair and safety engineers first began collaborating on the 2009 F-150 pick-up truck.\n\n\n\nDuring the vehicle's early development period, these engineers realized that new materials -- including ultra-high-strength steel and boron -- helped make the new truck safer, but also could make it more expensive to repair after a collision. AOL Autos: Minor damages, major repair costs\n\n\n\n\"The extensive use of advanced technologies and materials in the 2009 F-150 required us to develop new, specific procedures and repair recommendations,\" said Gerry Bonanni, Ford's collision repair senior engineer.\n\n\n\nSo, Ford engineers designed and developed new front and rear-frame-section kits -- which means one single section of the frame can now be repaired / replaced after a crash, instead of having to replace the entire frame.\n\n\n\n\"Partial-frame repairs cost at least $2,000 less than full-frame replacements,\" says Bonanni -- and will prevent some vehicles from being \"totaled,\" which would have previously been the case under repair laws in some states.\n\n\n\nThe success of the collaboration on the F-150 prompted the decision to open the new paint and body tech center. A more recent example was the work done on the 2010 Mustang.\n\n\n\n\"Previously, we had no real procedure for sectioning off the rear-frame rails,\" says Bonanni. \"But, by collaborating with repair technicians and the insurance companies, we developed a procedure, which we then documented for the repair techs in our dealers.\n\n\n\n\"That allows them to repair just a short section of the rear-frame rails, instead of replacing the entire frame-rail system ", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "(CNN)  -- The Tennis Channel has canceled plans to", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN)  -- The Tennis Channel has canceled plans to broadcast a tournament in Dubai because an Israeli player was banned.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsraeli tennis player Shahar Peer was denied a visa by the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\n\n\n\nShahar Peer, the 45th-ranked women's player according to the World Tennis Association, qualified to compete in this week's Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships but was denied a visa by the United Arab Emirates.

On August 13, a deputy responded to the site and did a \"cursory search\" but found nothing, Nieves said.\n\n\n\nCasey Anthony, 22, faces charges including first-degree murder in the June disappearance of her daughter, Caylee, who was 2 at the time. Remains described as being those of a small child were found last week a half-mile from Casey Anthony's parents' home, in the area where the meter reader first directed police.\n\n\n\nNieves said police were getting more information from the tipster and the deputy who responded to the tips. He said the department was investigating the \"thoroughness\" of the deputy's response but would not identify the deputy.\n\n\n\nThe meter reader \"is not a suspect,\" Nieves said. \"He is a credible witness.\"\n\n\n\nNieves' latest announcement is raising questions about whether police missed several chances to find remains believed to be Caylee's.\n\n\n\nThe meter reader is not the only one, or the first, to have pointed police toward the site containing the remains.\n\n\n\nKioMarie Cruz, Casey Anthony's childhood friend, also told police to investigate the same wooded area near Hidden Oaks Elementary School a month before the meter reader, according to CNN affiliate WFTV.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with detectives, according to WFTV, Cruz said that she and Anthony \"pretty much used to hang out there most of our time,\" would \"snack on food for hours\" and went there to \"get away from our parents.\"\n\n\n\nThe sheriff's office followed up on that tip, but the wooded area was covered in floodwaters, preventing a search.

Authorities have said the remains are believed to be Caylee's, but an identification is pending.\n\n\n\nSheriff's spokesman Carlos Padilla said last week that authorities believe the remains are Caylee's for three reasons: No other children have been reported missing in the area; the remains are consistent with those of a child of Caylee's age; and the remains were found near the home of the grandparents, where the 2-year-old and her mother were living just before Caylee disappeared.\n\n\n\nFBI spokesman Richard Kolko said Monday that he did not know when tests would be complete, but an attorney for Anthony's parents said the FBI is likely to have results \"within the next week.\"\n\n\n\nCasey Anthony could face a sentence of life in prison if convicted.

There has been no sign of her since August 19, 2007.\n\n\n\nLiza Murphy has been missing from her home in Emerson, New Jersey, since August 19, 2007.\n\n\n\nMurphy's friends and family reported her missing the next day.\n\n\n\n\"In my heart, I fear the worst, that my daughter is gone,\" said her mother, Sophia Stellatos.\n\n\n\nPolice searched extensively for Murphy, especially around a reservoir not far from her home, but they found nothing. Cadaver dogs caught her scent near the George Washington Bridge, but the trail went cold, police told the family.\n\n\n\nDeepening the mystery, her husband, Joe Murphy, tried to take his own life a few days after his wife disappeared by walking into oncoming traffic and throwing himself in front of a fire truck, police say.\n\n\n\nHe was hospitalized and recovered from his injuries, but police say he hired a lawyer and is no longer cooperating with investigators.\n\n\n\nHis lawyer said Murphy, an Irish immigrant, has nothing to hide from the authorities. He said his client has no criminal record and no history of violence. Attorney Joseph Rem added that there was no physical violence in the marriage.\n\n\n\nAccording to her family, Liza Murphy, 42, was not the type of person to take off on her own without letting her family know.

Stellatos described Joe Murphy as possessive of his wife, never allowing her to go out with her friends. She said he was even jealous if she spent time with her parents.\n\n\n\nRem pointed out that his client has not been named as a suspect or a person of interest in the case. He said police have not asked to speak to his client recently.\n\n\n\nLiza Murphy's children are 15, 13 and 10 years old now. Joe Murphy has full custody of them, and the Stellatoses have not seen their grandchildren since shortly before their daughter disappeared.\n\n\n\nMurphy and her children had spent the week before her disappearance visiting with her parents, who live about 125 miles away. They returned the Friday before Murphy's disappearance.\n\n\n\nPolice say both the Murphy home and their vehicles have been processed for forensics, but they found no evidence of foul play or struggle.\n\n\n\nLiza Murphy had been suffering from depression and was on medication for fibromyalgia, a painful condition that affects the muscles and soft tissues. Police say she may have been accosted after she left home, still stewing over the argument.\n\n\n\nThe police seek the public's help in this case.

The purported rape is another sad example of today's self-absorbed and uncaring youth. It was the media's glorification of violence that caused it. The horrific act shows how sociopathic brains develop. But it seems as if the majority of commentators have settled on the idea that the Richmond students did nothing because of the \"bystander effect\": The more people involved in a criminal incident, the less likely any one of them will intervene to do something about it.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, this \"What's wrong with our children?\" approach leads to a dead end, because it results in a sweeping moral condemnation of the schools, families and students in this community. These perpetrators committed a heinous act that should be widely condemned. But a discussion that focuses exclusively on the immorality of these deviant young men does not provide solutions that prevent gang rape from happening.\n\n\n\nTalking only about the bystander effect wrongly suggests that the vast majority of teens would not call for help. Take Richmond. Claims of depraved acts by a few kids have served to demonize an entire student community.\n\n\n\nRather than demonize all teenagers in Richmond High School, we should be asking another question: \"What can we do to prevent such heinous acts from happening?\"\n\n\n\nThe answer to that question leads to a wholly different kind of dialogue, one that may surprise. It is primarily students, the reputed problem, who can best prevent acts of violence on campus.\n\n\n\nMake no mistake about it. The alleged two-hour-long gang rape on October 24 was an extreme form of school violence. It unfolded not far from the gym where the school-sponsored homecoming dance, supervised by school staff and police officers, was being held. And students, police say, largely perpetrated it.\n\n\n\nResearch since the massacres at Columbine High School (1999) and Virginia Tech (2007) has taught us a lot about how to prevent such school violence. Chief among them is that school staff and security should patrol campuses, especially violence-prone areas, during and after school events.\n\n\n\nAccording to a CNN report, a friend of the alleged victim saw blatant failures in safety precautions. She said, \"I looked outside of the gym, and I saw 12 to 15 guys, sitting there, with no IDs. The officers -- not only did they not check the IDs of those students or men sitting outside of of our campus, but the security officers who are employed here did no job of checking either.\"\n\n\n\nVirtually all students and teachers at a school can identify these dangerous hot spots. At Richmond High School, one such spot is \"a dark alley near the back side of the school,\" the site of the purported rape.\n\n\n\nAs CNN reported, school officials had even requested that video cameras and more lights be installed in the area, but they were never installed. The alleged rapists and student bystanders probably knew that no one would be patrolling the area.\n\n\n\nAs important as campus patrols are in reducing campus violence, the most powerful form of prevention is believing that students can help stop crime from happening. They didn't stop the purported rape at Richmond, a skeptic might say. A possible reason is that they were not educated on how to stop it. .\n\n\n\nResearch shows us that students often know ahead of time when and where violence will flare up on campus. Strong social networks and the widespread use of cell phones and text messaging rapidly convey such information.\n\n\n\nThis dynamic can fuel violence, as officials say it did at Richmond High School. It can also prevent violence.

They prayed over the dead bodies and met with the family of the one victim who has been identified, a catechism teacher in a parish in Luanda whose last class was Saturday morning.\n\n\n\nMidway through the Mass, a long line of worshippers brought offerings to the pontiff, as an electric organ and guitar played a joyous tune over the sound of percussion instruments and a choir, members of which were wearing matching white baseball caps. Women carried local produce on their heads in wide baskets or tall jugs, many dancing to the music as they waited to meet the pope.\n\n\n\nThe 81-year-old pontiff mopped his face with a white handkerchief several times during the outdoor service, while many worshippers sought shelter from the sun under umbrellas.\n\n\n\nThe pope spoke in English and Portuguese, the language of Angola's former colonial rulers, during the hour-long service, while local clergy read short passages in tribal languages.\n\n\n\nBenedict has been in Africa since Tuesday. He returns to Rome on Monday.\n\n\n\nAfrica is the last continent that Benedict had left to visit, and one he could not avoid, said David Gibson, a biographer of the pope.\n\n\n\n\"He knows he has to do this.

But we found some smart, practical initiatives that point the way to a better future.\n\n\n\nThis test design for Personal Rapid Transit is part of plans for driverless pods to replace airport shuttles.\n\n\n\nDriverless pods at airports\n\n\n\nSomeday, driverless pods may be zipping passengers between an airport and its parking lots. Fully automated, pods are more convenient than shuttle buses driven by humans. Currently, 18 pods are being tested at London Heathrow's Terminal 5. They let you board when you want to, rather than wait for a bus on a fixed schedule. Punch in your destination, such as a parking lot, on a touch screen. Then leave the driving to the machine, which glides on rails at speeds of 25 mph. A bonus perk: The pods are battery powered, so they don't spew out environmentally destructive exhaust.\n\n\n\nImproved design of coach seats\n\n\n\nHong Kong based Cathay Pacific Airways has reinvented the economy-class seat: As the seat reclines, the bottom slides forward, but the back stays in place. So the passenger sitting behind doesn't have to endure a seat hovering inches from his or her chin. The new seats are especially welcome on long-distance hauls -- which happen to be routes Cathay Pacific flies regularly. American Airlines is among the other carriers reportedly interested in installing similar, slide-forward seats.\n\n\n\nIn-cabin mood lighting\n\n\n\nPoor cabin lighting on a long flight may worsen jet lag. For instance, exposure to bright light at an hour when you are ordinarily asleep can confuse your body's internal clock. But smart cabin lighting may actually help your body adjust to a new time zone -- and beat back jet lag. Virgin America has an in-cabin lighting system that subtly shifts through 12 shades of violet, including a welcoming, bright blue-purple during the day, a softer violet hue after dusk, and a deep, calming near-black on red-eyes when it's time to sleep. Elsewhere in the world, Air Canada, Malaysia Airlines, Singapore Airlines, and Thai Airways offer mood lighting on many long-haul flights.\n\n\n\nLuggage check before you get to the airport\n\n\n\nSchlepping your bags isn't fun. It's also not necessary -- at least not in the many capital cities where you can drop checked luggage at bus or train stations and forget about it until you land at your destination. Many passengers can check bags at London's Paddington station (for Heathrow flights), Vienna's Wien Mitte station, Moscow's Kievsky Station, and Hong Kong Station. In the U.S., the best advance luggage-check option is at Walt Disney World: Guests staying at Disney lodging can check bags at their hotel before hopping on the free Magical Express ride to the Orlando airport.\n\n\n\nPaperless boarding passes  Boarding passes printed on flimsy paper seem almost as outdated as paper airline tickets. Now, cell phone check-in is allowed at many airports, such as Chicago O'Hare and Los Angeles's LAX. Punch in your phone number at check-in and a bar code appears on your phone via e-mail or text message. Security officers and gate agents scan your phone's screen, making for an entirely paperless process. Some airlines, including American, Continental, and Delta (plus its sister unit, Northwest), plan to adopt the new technology at every airport gate nationwide.\n\n\n\nMore power --sockets -- for the people\n\n\n\nSometimes it's the simple things that count. Virgin America not only became the first airline to offer Wi-Fi on every flight, but it did so in an especially sensible way, with standard sockets (no adapter necessary) at every seat on the plane.

Its last known contact occurred at 02:33 a.m., the Brazilian air force spokesman added.\n\n\n\nThe assumption is that these electrical problems led to a catastrophic failure of the aircraft's controls.  What brought Flight AF 447 down? \u00bb\n\n\n\nSome experts have said that a lightning strike was a possibility, particularly since the plane disappeared in a storm-prone area along the equator known as the Intertropical Convergence zone (ITCZ). This is where the trade winds of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres converge. The intense sun and warm water of the equator heats the air in the ITCZ, raising its humidity and making it buoyant. Aided by the convergence of the trade winds, the buoyant air rises, releasing the accumulated moisture in an almost constant series of thunderstorms.  The airliner's route \u00bb\n\n\n\nAccording to CNN's Mari Ramos, these storms can reach altitudes of 52,000 ft -- way beyond the capacity of commercial airliners to fly over.  Watch more about the weather systems \u00bb\n\n\n\nRetired airline pilot John Cox told CNN that modern aircraft receive a constant stream of real time weather data which allows them to plot a course around storms. \"Because safety is the paramount concern, airliners don't fly into storms. They fly around them,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"The ITCZ is no different. Planes fly through it every day.\n\n\n\n\"At 8 miles per minute, modern jets can easily fly around storms. Even if they encounter turbulence, they're designed to absorb it.\"\n\n\n\nWhen lightning strikes a plane, the bolt typically hits a sharp part of it, such as a wing tip. Huge amounts of energy surge through the aircraft before exiting out of another sharp point, such as the tail. But sometimes high voltages can cause electrical damage if components are not well-grounded.\n\n\n\nUnlike other aircraft where the pilot's controls are manually attached to the flaps and rudders, Airbus 330 airliners are equipped with a \"fly by wire\" system that sends electronic signals from an onboard computer to move key control surfaces.\n\n\n\nExperts say that it is possible for this system and its back-up computers to be disabled by lightning. \"If you have a massive electrical problem it's possible that you could cut off all the commands out to the control surfaces,\" said aeronautics expert John Hansman.\n\n\n\nHowever, Kieran Daly, from the online aviation news service Air Transport Intelligence, told CNN that this scenario, while not impossible, is inconceivable. \"It's more likely that lightning would cause a fire or punch a hole through the aircraft structure,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"It could be significant that the jet reported a loss of pressure.\"\n\n\n\nHe added that the aircraft would be able to continue without the fly-by-wire system. The \"trim tab,\" which enables the pilot to manually manipulate controls such as the rudder, would allow the crew to fly the aircraft safely. \"Pilots are routinely trained for these kinds of events in a simulator,\" he said.\n\n\n\nFormer Airbus pilot John Wiley said on average every airliner is hit by a strike once a year. \"They don't go down,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAccording to Air France, the ", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN)  -- U.S. President-elect B", "paragraphs": [{"context": "CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN)  -- U.S. President-elect Barack Obama announced key members of his energy team on Monday, naming physicist Steven Chu as secretary of energy, and former EPA administrator Carol Browner to a new post in the White House to coordinate energy and climate policy.\n\n\n\nCarol Browner was one of four key environmental nominees named by Obama.\n\n\n\nObama also named Lisa Jackson, former head of New Jersey's environmental agency, to serve as his Environmental Protection Agency administrator, and Nancy Sutley, the Los Angeles deputy mayor for energy and environment, to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality.\n\n\n\nSutley, a prominent supporter of Sen.

Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush or Ronald Reagan.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy the hesitance? Because they also understand that a direct attack on President Obama could hurt them in two ways: They could find themselves cut off from the administration or they could anger their base by making the president's job more difficult when he is facing daily attacks from Republicans.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven among African-American commentators, columnists and radio and TV show hosts, if you are too harsh on President Obama, the backlash has been swift and vicious.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe organizations know this, and trust me, the White House knows this, and has used it to its advantage.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's why I call it the Obama-Black-Two-Step.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been told countless times by folks on both sides that Obama can't be seen as favoring African-Americans over others, and his White House has been especially scared of touching anything dealing with race.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, black civil rights leaders and prominent Democrats have largely bitten their tongues, unwilling to publicly take on the president and some of his decisions. Instead, they quietly fume, mumbling under their breath and offering their critiques in measured tones.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet I have gotten the sense that black civil rights and political leaders may stop the racial solidarity and stand up on the principles they have long fought for.

Yet this time, for highly qualified African-American female judges, such as Leah Ward Sears, the retired chief justice of the Georgia Supreme Court, to never make the cut for a face-to-face interview with the president has ticked off a number of leaders I've talked with over the last several days.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the big deal about including a black woman? A Democratic pollster told me that black women have a higher voter turnout than any other ethnic-gender demographic -- 65 percent -- and it's vital for Obama to appeal to them.

One was that Iran should develop a robust civilian nuclear capability and a robust missile program but that it should not put the two together because that would place it in clear violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. There are clearly others in Iran who believe that Iran should simply have nuclear weapons. ...\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would suggest that the harder line faction within Iran is winning out.

I also think the sanctions that are being talked about are fairly narrow and targeted at particularly the Republican Guard within the regime, which seems to be most powerful faction.

My wife's first name was spelled Crista instead of Christa.\n\n\n\nI immediately called Expedia, and was told I should have contacted them the day the e-mail was sent to me and that there would be a $150 re-ticketing fee. After several more calls and being put on \"hold\" for more than half an hour, a supervisor told me that there was nothing they could do. They couldn't even change the name on the ticket.\n\n\n\nI contacted the airline directly and they told me they would make a note on my wife's passenger record. My wife's tickets are still wrong and I'm afraid we may have a problem with our connecting airline or with customs. What can I do?\n\n\n\n-- Frank Santa Maria, New Braunfels, Texas\n\n\n\nA: Expedia should have spelled your wife's name correctly. When it was clear that the company had made an error, it should have done everything in its power to fix it instead of giving you the runaround and forcing you to deal directly with your airline.\n\n\n\nThen again, it should have never come to this. First, why are you phoning an online travel agency to buy tickets? It may be more convenient, but online agencies are built to handle your purchases online. It's more efficient and reduces the chance of an error being introduced -- like misspelling a passenger's name.\n\n\n\nSecond, you should always check your verification e-mail immediately. Expedia could have made a change to your ticket if you had caught the mistake earlier. It's essential that you review your itinerary as soon as possible. Believe me, I know. I just made this mistake and had to spend an extra day at my destination because I put the wrong date in my reservation. (See? It can happen to anyone.)\n\n\n\nI've dealt with too many wrong-name cases to count, and here are a few things I've learned. Passengers aren't turned away at the gate because of a typographical error on their tickets. Reservations systems have limitations that sometimes truncate last names or render non-English names in funny characters. Last names and first names are frequently flip-flopped. Ticket agents, gate agents and security screeners know that, and will let you through.\n\n\n\nI haven't heard of anyone being denied boarding because of a one-character difference in a name. I'm reasonably sure your wife would have been allowed to travel using her ticket, even if this had happened after the May 15 implementation of the first phase of the Transportation Security Administration's \"Secure Flight\" initiative, which requires that you provide your full name as it appears on your government-issued identification.\n\n\n\nIncidentally, the \"notation\" in her reservation would have almost certainly been visible to any connecting airline. And a customs agent wouldn't even pay attention to your ticket under normal circumstances. It's your customs form and passport that matter to them.\n\n\n\nNext time you buy tickets by phone -- and I hope there's no next time -- do yourself a big favor: When you offer your name to the agent, ask to have it spelled back. That way, you'll catch any errors before the transaction goes through. Once you have a reservation, it becomes much more difficult (or even impossible) to make a change.\n\n\n\nIt shouldn't be that way. In an ideal world, you'd be able to change a name on a ticket. Airlines say they can't allow name changes for \"security reasons\" but I'm inclined to believe it has more to do with the fact that they ", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- Jury selection was under way Thursday in ", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Jury selection was under way Thursday in the case of a man accused of sexually assaulting a toddler and capturing it on videotape years ago, a crime that triggered a nationwide manhunt and search for the girl when the tape surfaced in 2007.\n\n\n\nChester Arthur Stiles faces life imprisonment if convicted of videtaping a sexual assault on a child.\n\n\n\nChester Arthur Stiles, 38, faces 22 felony counts in connection with the videotape, including lewdness with a child, sexual assault with a minor and attempted sexual assault with a minor.

As of Thursday morning, only seven jurors had passed on to the next stage of selection, Sommermeyer said.\n\n\n\nProsecutors hope to seat 15 jurors eventually, Sommermeyer told CNN, meaning they'll want a pool of about 35 to pick from in the final stage.\n\n\n\nPicking a jury in the case is challenging, according to KVBC, not only because of the media attention the case has drawn, but because of the crimes Stiles is accused of. A questionnaire given to potential jurors has one question addressing the videotape: \"As a juror, despite the graphic nature of the videotape, can you promise to remain fair and impartial and objectively evaluate all evidence for returning a verdict?\"\n\n\n\n\"One, you let them know what the case involves and they've heard it on the news, it's a little difficult to get over any preconceived notions that they had about the case,\" defense attorney Stacey Roundtree told KVBC.\n\n\n\n\"However, we do have faith in this community that they want to do the right thing,\" she said. \"Most of the jury trials I've had, the jurors go out of their way to make the right decision.

If I lived in \"Mad Men\" land for a day, I would totally make out with him on his Sterling-Cooper purchased desk. In real life? Not so much. At least not anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon Draper of \"Mad Men\" is a complicated man underneath a confident exterior, columnist warns.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes Don Draper so drool-worthy on screen does not translate in real life. Actually, certain things do translate -- tall, dark and handsome is still tall, dark, and handsome in the real world.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that aloof, secretive, and calculating personality that seduces his onscreen paramours and the show's viewers? Not easy to live with.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon Draper is written as an extremely complicated and deeply flawed man who does some awful things, like cheating repeatedly on his wife, Betty, and using information he gleans from her therapist to manipulate her.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the reasons and motivations behind his repulsive actions are slowly being revealed with each new episode. As with any TV show or movie, we itch to know what possesses someone to do the things he does, and we expect that writers as glorious as the ones behind \"Mad Men\" will eventually lead us to deep understanding of who Don Draper is and how he will evolve into a better man.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn real life, such life-changing revelations don't always come.\n\n\n\n\n\nI dated a Don Draper-type for years. There were superficial similarities, like that they both worked in similar industries (just decades apart) and had a knack for always being \"on.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGuys like Don Draper are great at their jobs for a multitude of reasons, but one of them is that they present themselves as calm, collected, and unmoved by the opinions and emotions of others.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a business situation this comes across as professional, confident, and reassuring to the client that the task at hand will be accomplished flawlessly. In a real-life romantic relationship, the refusal or inability to \"turn it off\" can be frustrating and painful for the other person involved.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, being one of the few who is able to get past the facade feels powerful. When you're in love, having that power only makes you feel even more special.

Knowing those reasons -- or at least some of them -- makes viewers sympathetic to him. There's an abused boy beneath that tough exterior! A man with secrets so big, he has to hide behind a wall all of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetty Draper may not know Don's secrets, but they do share a bond he doesn't have with other people. The women he cheats with? They don't know him at all and they don't have the ability or even the interest in seeing something deeper like Betty does.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're not threatening to his persona, but she is. These are, of course, just excuses for his bad behavior that should never fly in real life.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy ex had his own reasons for presenting a facade, for not letting anyone get too close, for acting like a jerk; some he shared, some I figured out, but all made me want to stay with him. The Frisky: Could you get past hearing \"I don't love you anymore?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't know if my Draper-esque ex cheated -- though I suspect he did -- but I do think he broke up with me because I was a threat.

Stanley McChrystal, wants 40,000 more pairs of boots on the ground.\n\n\n\nInitial reports about the cables sent by Eikenberry appeared in The New York Times, Washington Post and Los Angeles Times. All three newspapers attributed the reports to senior U.S. officials, without identifying them. Two U.S. officials confirmed to CNN that Eikenberry sent two cables to Washington expressing reservations about troop increases amid uncertainty over President Hamid Karzai's government.\n\n\n\nNeither Eikenberry nor the White House would comment on the contents of private advice between the envoy and the president, but the reports alarmed Karzai enough that his office sought confirmation from the U.S. Embassy about them, a Karzai spokesman told CNN.\n\n\n\nKarzai's office did not get the information it sought, the spokesman said.\n\n\n\nWhatever Eikenberry told the president, the ambassador is unusually well versed in the military problems facing Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nHe retired from the Army after nearly 40 years of service with the rank of lieutenant general on April 28 -- one day before he was sworn in as ambassador, according to his State Department biography.\n\n\n\nHis long military career included time in Kabul as U.S. security coordinator and chief of the Office of Military Cooperation.\n\n\n\n\"Afghanistan has been at the center of my career since 9/11, when the terrorist-commandeered aircraft crashed into the Pentagon just below the office in which I was working,\" Eikenberry said at his Senate confirmation hearing in March.\n\n\n\n\"There is no silver bullet and no quick, cheap or easy solutions.

The program lets people bark commands or ask questions to the phone, and it will provide an answer or ask follow-up questions in order to perform a given task.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the news conference, Phil Schiller, Apple's marketing executive, called Siri \"the coolest feature of the new iPhone 4S,\" and the company is expected to advertise Siri heavily in its sales pitches.\n\n\n\n\n\nApple dedicated a significant chunk of the presentation to showing the extent of Siri's ability to interpret requests and respond. \"Do I need a raincoat today?\" incites a robo-female voice to reply: \"It sure looks like rain today,\" as Scott Forstall, Apple's mobile software executive, demonstrated.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk Siri to remind you to buy flowers for your wife at a certain time, and Siri may ask you to identify her in the phone's address book. Siri then remembers who she is for future requests, Forstall said. The software integrates with Yelp and WolframAlpha for relevant queries. It can also schedule appointments in the phone's calendar and transcribe e-mails or text messages.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Google's Android phones, users can dictate messages, too, which are then transcribed by Google's servers. Other cell phones support voice commands, which is handy when operating a phone while driving, but few people take advantage of the option. Even the preceding iPhones had a basic version of this called Voice Control, which can be activated in the same way as Siri, by holding down the phone's home button.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Apple's ambitions for Siri are much greater.\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve Jobs has said that Siri's focus is on artificial intelligence. \"We like what they do a lot,\" the Apple co-founder and former CEO said at the AllThingsD conference last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nForstall echoed that onstage Tuesday, saying: \"I've been in the AI field a long time, and this still blows me away.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe big unveiling of the iPhone 4S on Tuesday was the first time most people learned about Siri, but the voice-assistant software is rooted in many years of extensive technical research.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project was born at SRI International, a nonprofit research organization. It was a part of an ambitious project called CALO, for Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes. The program was funded by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the government division responsible for Global Position System (GPS) and developments that led to the creation of the Internet.\n\n\n\n\n\nWork on Siri began in the summer of 2007, and SRI executives decided to spin out the project as a standalone business in 2008. Apple acquired the company in April 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The team was so happy when Apple did the acquisition,\" Norman Winarsky, a Siri co-founder who remained at SRI, said in an interview on Monday. \"They have a vision.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore joining Apple, Siri provided a free app for iOS mobile devices. Apple removed it from the App Store on Tuesday, which means only iPhone 4S owners will be able to access the service starting next week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe version integrated into the 4S is vastly superior to the now-defunct app based on onstage demos. Apple spokespeople did not respond to CNN's requests to try the product at the event on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nSiri's engineers were excited for the opportunity to bake their software deeply into the new iPhone and build features that a third-party developer would not be able to do because of Apple-imposed restrictions, Winarsky said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are going to be very proud,\" he said. \"The world of virtual personal assistants is going to be everywhere.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSiri's specialty is in its ability to interpret so-called natural-language requests.

It wasn't long before he took his talent out of the bedroom, playing with high-school band The Iguanas, from which he later took his stage name.\n\n\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1965, Iggy formed a blues band called the Prime Movers. Following a brief stint at the University of Michigan he moved to Chicago, playing drums with local bluesmen, before returning to Michigan with his sights set on fronting a rock band.  Watch Iggy Pop show CNN around Miami \u00bb\n\n\n\nIn 1967, he recruited guitarist Ron Asheton, his drummer brother Scott Asheton and bassist Dave Alexander and formed The Psychedelic Stooges.\n\n\n\nIt was after seeing the Doors in concert, and inspired by Jim Morrison's confrontational stage persona, that James Osterberg reinvented himself as Iggy Pop, a drug-fueled, crazed whirling dervish of a front man, who would strut semi-naked around the stage, roll around in broken glass and dive headlong into the audience.\n\n\n\nThe band shortened its name to The Stooges and released its eponymous debut in 1969. Right from the start there was clearly something different about Iggy Pop. At the height of flower power, when The Stooges' contemporaries were singing about peace and love, Iggy was singing \"No Fun\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Dog.\"  See photos of Iggy in action. \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe album was a brilliant mess of raw, blues-influenced garage rock, but it sold poorly, as did the 1970 follow up \"Fun House,\" later described by Jack White of the White Stripes as \"the definitive rock album of America.\" Watch Iggy Pop show CNN around Miami\n\n\n\nBy this time, Iggy had begun the Heroin use that would plague his career and in 1971, The Stooges split up after being dropped by their record label. That same year, Iggy met David Bowie, who took him to England, re-united The Stooges and produced 1973's \"Raw Power.\"\n\n\n\nWith \"Raw Power,\" Iggy and the Stooges created the blueprint for punk rock and made an album that would one day be regarded as a landmark in rock music, an album that Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain listed as his favorite of all time. Nonetheless, it was another commercial failure and in 1974, The Stooges split again.\n\n\n\nBy this time, Heroin had taken over Iggy's life and in 1975 he checked himself into a Los Angeles mental institution in an effort to kick the habit. Bowie visited him there and took Iggy along on his 1976 tour, before the pair moved to West Berlin in an effort to get away from the temptation of drugs.\n\n\n\nIt was there that Bowie produced and co-wrote Iggy's 1977 solo albums, \"The Idiot\" and \"Lust for Life.\" The latter included the songs \"The Passenger\" and \"Lust for Life,\" which have since become staples of TV ads and movie soundtracks, spawning countless cover versions.\n\n\n\nMore commercial than The Stooges' records, Iggy's solo albums were met with critical acclaim and better sales, but never breakthrough into the mainstream. Songs that Bowie wrote with Iggy during this period were later included on Bowie albums, with \"China Girl\" becoming a hit single for Bowie.\n\n\n\nIggy carried on touring and releasing albums throughout the 80s, without much commercial success, although the single \"Real Wild Child\" was a hit in the U.S. and UK.

Richard Phillips was rescued, the piracy incident was discussed as one of the \"tests\" of President Obama that Joe Biden warned about during the campaign.\n\n\n\nOthers wondered whether wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have stretched our military resources too thin to respond effectively to these kinds of provocations. Many expressed outrage at the brand of naval gangsterism that by some estimates generated as much as $80 million in 2008.\n\n\n\nClearly this escalating pattern of pirate attacks may soon constitute an international crisis. But what this situation actually reveals is how little we've learned in the nearly eight years since George W. Bush declared war on terror.\n\n\n\nSomalia is like Afghanistan in that we had a great deal of interest in the place during the Cold War and more or less forgot about it afterward. The United States supported the government of Said Barre during the 1980s primarily for the same reason we began funneling aid to the Afghan rebels: anticommunism.\n\n\n\nBarre was a regional counterpoint to the Marxist regime next door in Ethiopia and strategically important enough for his human rights abuses to be tolerated. And like Afghanistan, Somalia quickly fell into disarray after the Cold War ended and the United States cut off support.\n\n\n\nDuring the early post-Cold War era, the United States developed a more narrowly defined set of interests and it was common to hear American foreign policy circles express disdain for \"nation-building\" projects. But two decades later we continue to deal with the consequences of our abrupt exit from both countries.\n\n\n\nOur fleeting humanitarian concern with Somalia ended with the downing of two Blackhawk helicopters in 1993. But that incident actually served as a kind of foreshadowing and highlighted yet another link to Afghanistan: The forces that attacked American troops in Mogadishu were reportedly linked to al Qaeda.\n\n\n\nThe 9/11 attacks and Afghanistan's role in sheltering al Qaeda should have given us reason to re-examine other regions where similar blowback might take place. In short, we might well have looked at what was going on in Afghanistan after September 11, 2001, and seen trouble on the horizon elsewhere.\n\n\n\nThe Somali situation was further complicated by a series of economic and ecological problems that have struck the region in the past decade. In the wake of the government collapse, the Somali coast became a target of illegal commercial fishing. This is a problem across East and Southern Africa but rampant in Somalia. According to one report, some 700 vessels were illegally operating in the region and fishing the local stock to near depletion.\n\n\n\nAs recently as 2006 Somali fishermen complained to the U.N. that illegal fishing was driving them to the brink of economic collapse. To add to the burden, the coast also became a favorite locale for nuclear waste dumping.\n\n\n\nIn 2005, U.N. officials confirmed that barrels containing illegally dumped nuclear waste had cracked open during the tsunami that year and begun washing ashore. The situation was widely reported by international news outlets with virtually no consequences.\n\n\n\nNo matter what we think of their current methods, it's impossible to solve the piracy problem without addressing the illegal fishing issue. Somalia lacks a functioning navy -- or government. Similarly, we were not talking about the over-fishing and nuclear waste issues -- to the extent we do talk about them now -- before the Somalis began to respond in kind.\n\n\n\nThese environmental violations will undoubtedly cost lives and the West has more or less ignored Somali pleas. Our intense and highly selective outrage began when the Somalis started targeting commercial vehicles.\n\n\n\nFaced with this response it's hard to avoid the conclusion that the Western consumer products, carried by these ships are more valuable than Somali lives.\n\n\n\nGiven the recent history of unstable states like Afghanistan and Iraq, piracy is actually one of the milder ", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- Iran could see widespread protests this w", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Iran could see widespread protests this weekend, as a day of mourning for the most prominent cleric to oppose the regime coincides with the major Shiite holy day of Ashura.\n\n\n\n\n\nIran -- whose regime exists as an explicitly Shiite Muslim leadership -- may find it politically and culturally difficult to put a lid on the marking of Ashura this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt falls on Sunday -- which happens to be a week to the day since the death of Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, a key figure in the 1979 Iranian revolution.

But it takes place in an unlikely spot: a 2,700-acre sanctuary in rural Tennessee.\n\n\n\nIt's not where nature intended the animals to be, roaming free in the vast expanses of subtropical Africa and Asia.\n\n\n\nBut for most of them, it's a life far apart from the ones they once lived.\n\n\n\nTarra lived in the back of a truck at a tire store.\n\n\n\nShirley performed at a circus until she broke her leg on a chain. Then, she was moved to the freak show.\n\n\n\nAnd Sissy was treated like a killer. She crushed a handler in her enclosure at a Texas zoo where video shows she'd been beaten into submission with ax handles.\n\n\n\n\"We consider all of these elephants to be rescue elephants, because they are taken out of that environment that is not healthy for them,\" said Carol Buckley, co-founder of the Elephant Sanctuary.\n\n\n\nFounded in 1995 on 112 acres about 30 miles southwest of Nashville, the sanctuary is now the largest natural refuge of its kind in the United States. Twenty-four elephants, most of them sick, old or abused, have lived at the sanctuary; it is currently home to 15 African and Asian elephants.\n\n\n\nIt's a place where elephants can roam freely, largely feed and shelter themselves and interact with others, often after years living alone in captivity.\n\n\n\nBut Buckley and Scott Blais, the nonprofit sanctuary's co-founder, are very clear about what it's not. The sanctuary is not a zoo.\n\n\n\nVisitors aren't allowed onto the property to view the elephants, and only a handful of media members are able to visit each year, in an effort to make the animals' lives as natural as possible.\n\n\n\n\"In order to accommodate the public, you would have to take away from the elephants,\" Buckley said. \"People have their own emotions, that energy,\" Buckley said. \"If you feel fear and they get close, they're going to get hit with your energy.\n\n\n\nFor Buckley, the journey to running the sanctuary -- which operates on private donations and corporate sponsorships -- started with Tarra.\n\n\n\nStudying to be a circus trainer, she bought the elephant, then just a year old, and trained her to perform. But as the years passed and the relationship between animal and trainer strengthened, Buckley came to believe that captivity, particularly in a traveling circus, was no life for an elephant.\n\n\n\n\"I didn't realize that elephants in captivity were suffering and that to train and dominate an elephant was really breaking their spirit,\" she said. \"When you come to love elephants, when you really come to understand them and love them, you want more for them.\n\n\n\n\"And when you learn how elephants live in the wild, it just makes sense that you would want to create a space that resembles that so elephants can just be elephants.\"\n\n\n\nFrom years in the circus and in zoos, Buckley and Tarra made their way to a breeding program at a Canadian wildlife safari, where they met Blais. It was then that the idea for the Elephant Sanctuary was born.\n\n\n\n\"We started talking about elephants in captivity and what we could do and what we should be doing for them, what they truly deserved,\" Blais said.\n\n\n\nAt the preserve, the elephants feed themselves primarily by grazing -- the Asian elephants eat as much as 100 pounds of grass a day -- supplemented with grains and vitamins from the staff.

The first tournament took place in 1997 with 13 teams, but now annual events take place in Sweden, Iceland, Russia and Brazil which can often feature over 200 teams.

The National Guardsmen were assigned to protect the civilian workers.\n\n\n\nThe Guardsmen and civilian contractors who worked there have described walking on and sitting near the bright orange powder that was widely dispersed throughout the grounds of the water plant. The chemical was believed to have been left behind by forces loyal to Saddam Hussein.\n\n\n\nSome of the Guardsmen already suffer from nasal tumors or respiratory system problems and other health problems, according to the lawsuit. One of the guardsmen may have died from the exposure, though the exact cause of his death earlier this year is still not clear.\n\n\n\nThe odorless sodium dichromate was used at the plant as an anti-corrosive, the lawsuit says. The chemical contained nearly pure hexavalent chromium, the toxic substance that poisoned homeowners in Hinkley, California, and was made famous by activist Erin Brockovich, according to the suit.\n\n\n\nFor the Guardsmen, KBR's \"knowing acts and omissions\" resulted in \"months and months of unprotected, unknowing, direct exposure to one of the most potent carcinogens and mutagenic substances known to man,\" the lawsuit alleges.\n\n\n\nA spokeswoman for KBR said the company was still reviewing the lawsuit, but denied responsibility for creating unsafe conditions at the plant.\n\n\n\n\"We are not providing comment on the suit at this time.

He said: \"My biggest impression today is the obligation to carry out the mission of defending Israel.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month, two Israeli warships and a submarine made a rare journey through Egypt's Suez canal. Last year, the Israeli air force tested its fighter jets and helicopters on a 870-mile sortie -- roughly the distance between Israel and Iran's main uranium enrichment plant at Natanz.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe official line... Israel's security is a continuing concern. The common perception is that some, if not all of these exercises were a show of strength for Iran.\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimates of when Iran could have a nuclear bomb differ widely.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February, the Institute for Science and International Security released a report that concluded Iran does not have a nuclear weapon but does have enough low-enriched uranium for a single nuclear weapon.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut an official at the International Atomic Energy Agency cautioned about drawing such conclusions. The U.N. nuclear watchdog agency said Iran's stock of low-enriched uranium would have to be turned into highly enriched uranium to be weapons-grade material.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe official said in February that Iran has not done so, and the agency's monitors and surveillance equipment at the Natanz facility would be able to detect any such activity.\n\n\n\n\n\nDore Gold, former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations said, \"The IAEA has inspected the known nuclear sites of Iran.

Mike Huckabee on Tuesday said he accepts \"full responsibility\" for granting clemency in 2000 to a man authorities say gunned down four Lakewood, Washington, police officers Sunday.\n\n\n\nMaurice Clemmons, 37, was shot and killed early Tuesday by Seattle police. He was the subject of a two-day manhunt after the four officers were killed at a coffee shop as they met before their shifts began Sunday morning.\n\n\n\nClemmons had a criminal history in Arkansas and Washington. In May 2000, Huckabee commuted his 108-year prison sentence to make him immediately eligible for parole, which was granted by the parole board two months later. Clemmons had been sentenced to 95 years, to run after time he was already serving on previous convictions.\n\n\n\nIn a statement on the conservative news Web site Newsmax.com, Huckabee wrote that he commuted Clemmons' sentence from 108 years to 47 years. Reports that he had pardoned Clemmons or set him free were erroneous, he said.\n\n\n\n\"I take full responsibility for my actions of nine years ago,\" Huckabee said. \"I acted on the facts presented to me in 2000. If I could have possibly known what Clemmons would do nine years later, I obviously would have made a different decision. But if the same file was presented to me today, I would have likely made the same decision.\"\n\n\n\nBut the Arkansas prosecutor who put Clemmons behind bars told CNN on Tuesday that Huckabee was issuing clemency at \"an astounding rate\" during his tenure as governor.\n\n\n\n\"He was exercising the clemency power at what I call a wholesale rate,\" Larry Jegley said. \"He was letting murderers out, he was letting rapists out, and he was letting the likes of Mr. Clemmons out.\"\n\n\n\nOne survey, he said, showed Huckabee issued more clemencies from 1996 to 2004 than the governors of all six surrounding states, including Texas.\n\n\n\nHe said he didn't know why so many clemencies were granted. \"That was part of the frustration that we felt with the entire process. ... We never felt as though he gave victims, their families, jurors, law enforcement and the community in general an adequate explanation as to why he felt compelled to let people of proven danger go in our community.\"\n\n\n\nHuckabee was a Republican presidential candidate in the 2008 election and has not ruled out another White House bid in 2012. During his 2008 campaign, he was criticized for granting clemency to another inmate, convicted rapist Wayne DuMond, who was later convicted of raping and murdering a woman in Missouri.\n\n\n\n\"Between 1,000 and 2,000 requests for some form of clemency came to my desk each and every one of the 10\u00bd years I was governor,\" Huckabee said Tuesday. \"Ninety-two percent of the time, I denied the requests.\"\n\n\n\nHe noted that in Arkansas, a governor does not initiate a sentence change -- the Post Prison Transfer Board makes a recommendation to the governor after reviewing an inmate's file. The governor then can grant or deny it.\n\n\n\nClemmons was 16 when he was charged with robbery and burglary. \"For the crimes he committed and the age at which he committed the crimes, [a 108-year sentence] was dramatically outside the norm for sentencing,\" Huckabee said. The board unanimously recommended that the sentence be commuted.\n\n\n\nJegley said that while in prison in Arkansas, Clemmons had a disciplinary record for violent incidents, and that something should have tipped off the board or the governor that \"this man was not a good candidate to be put back in society, because he couldn't live in the cloistered environment of prison and stay out of trouble.\"\n\n\n\nWatch what Jegley has to say\n\n\n\nIn the case of any form of clemency -- a commutation or a full pardon -- notice is given to the prosecutor, the judge, law enforcement officials, the attorney general and the secretary of state, as well as the media, for a public response period, Huckabee said. \"The only record of public response to the notice to commute was from the trial judge, who recommended the commendation in concert with the board.\"\n\n\n\nJegley ", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Natalie Cole's se", "paragraphs": [{"context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Natalie Cole's search for a new kidney ended this week when someone with a compatible organ died and their family asked that it be given to the singer, according to the organ procurement group that handled the donation.\n\n\n\nNatalie Cole received a kidney transplant Tuesday in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nCole, who underwent a successful kidney transplant at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles Tuesday, was \"responding well and recuperating\" Thursday, her publicist said.\n\n\n\nCole had been on what she called \"a very long list\" of people waiting for an organ donation when she got word recently that OneLegacy, an organ procurement agency in Southern California, had a kidney that was a biological match.\n\n\n\nIt was a \"directed donation\" from a deceased organ donor, according to OneLegacy CEO Tom Mone.\n\n\n\n\"Having heard of Ms. Cole's need for a kidney, the family asked that one of their loved one's kidneys be transplanted to Ms. Cole if they were a match,\" Mone said.\n\n\n\nDirected organ donations are rare, and rarer still are those directed to someone not related to or known personally by the deceased, he said.\n\n\n\nThe donor will remain anonymous until the family gives permission for the name to be made public, he said.\n\n\n\nCole's need for a kidney donation was highly publicized, including with an appearance on CNN's \"Larry King Live\" on March 31.\n\n\n\n\"I'm on a very long list, which is why we are looking to donors,\" said Cole, the daughter of legendary crooner Nat King Cole.\n\n\n\nCole said her kidney troubles date to February 2008 when she was diagnosed with Hepatitis C.

It also produced American Seung-Hui Cho who killed 32 students and himself at Virginia Tech and American John Wayne Gacy, Jr., who raped and murdered 33 young men and boys in Chicago, Illinois, in the 1970s.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same Judaism that produced Martin Buber, Emanuel Levinas, or Primo Levi also produced the Stern Gang, Meir Kahane and Baruch Goldstein.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the knee jerk reaction of blaming Islam and Muslims, in general, or looking for delusional links to \"al Qaeda,\" for the horrific murders at Fort Hood points to something far more fundamental, overdue, and urgent -- namely something of a psychological barrier for Americans to accept the Islamic component of their own society, culture, and history.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid singling out Islam as diabolical, it is imperative for Americans to come to terms with the collectively repressed fact that by far the most important social uprising of their 20th century -- namely the civil rights movement of the 1960s -- is not as exclusively a Christian phenomenon as it is made out to be: The towering figure of a Muslim revolutionary named Malcolm X is of great importance in the history of that movement.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt took a whole generation of Americans to accept the fact that Jewish civil rights activists were instrumental in many measures of the success that was achieved in the 1960s. It is long overdue for Americans also to recognize that Malcolm X was equally, if not more, important to the civil rights movement.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe way the history of the civil rights movement is mostly remembered now, an overwhelming role is assigned to the Southern Baptist genealogy of Martin Luther King Jr. Malcolm X is ", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Beijing, China (CNN) -- Chinese President Hu Jinta", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Beijing, China (CNN) -- Chinese President Hu Jintao greeted U.S. President Barack Obama in China's capital on Tuesday, with trade and the thorny issue of North Korea expected to be on their agenda.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. delegation was met by an honor guard at the Great Hall of the People, and Obama shook hands with Hu and other top Chinese officials before the two leaders went behind closed doors.

Oddly enough, for once, the battle didn't come.\n\n\n\nI told my teenage daughter I wanted her to get the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine the next time she went to see her doctor.\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, sorry. You have to.\"\n\n\n\n\"I heard it hurts.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, that's too bad. But it might prevent you from getting cancer later in life.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh. (pause) OK.\"\n\n\n\nIf you were keeping score, you might chalk that one up as a Mom win.\n\n\n\nThe only problem with that is after winning over my daughter, I now had to convince myself. This drug has its own emotional battlefields.\n\n\n\nThe HPV vaccine has been available to the public for almost two years. When Merck launched it in 2006 under the name Gardasil, many people enthusiastically embraced it as a wonder drug. Dr. Kevin Ault, associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory University's School of Medicine, says the vaccine helps women avoid an assortment of ailments, some not too serious, but others that are potentially deadly.\n\n\n\n\"There are about 100 different types of human papillomavirus,\" he said. \"Some of them are pretty common and not dangerous, like plantar warts or warts on your hand. About 30 of them infect the genital tract, and about a dozen of them are associated with cancer.\"  Health for Her: Watch more the HPV vaccine and girls \u00bb\n\n\n\nIn this case, the cancer Ault is talking about is cervical cancer.\n\n\n\nThe National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2008, there will be over 11,000 new cases of cervical cancer diagnosed and almost 4,000 women will die from it in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that at least 50 percent of people who have had sex will have one type of HPV at some time in their lives.\n\n\n\nGiven those stats, this vaccine would seem like a pretty good thing, right?\n\n\n\nThe hitch is that the vaccine is suggested for adolescent girls, but the viruses in question are sexually transmitted. And that is one of the big reasons the HPV vaccine has divided parents in the question of \"to give or not to give.\"\n\n\n\nLet's face it. Parents don't like thinking about their daughters having sex at all. Ever. Now a new drug comes along, and not only are parents told they should embrace this new vaccine for their young daughters, but it's also part of the set of routine vaccines that doctors are strongly encouraged to give their patients.\n\n\n\nMerck says the drug has been safely tested for girls and women between the ages of 9 and 26. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that girls get the vaccine at age 11 or 12.\n\n\n\nAult explains why youth is key. Human papillomavirus is sexually transmitted, \"so one of the advantages of giving it to adolescents is that they are unlikely to have been sexually active, so they will not have been exposed ", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Ten South Afri", "paragraphs": [{"context": "JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Ten South African ministers and the deputy president have resigned as President Thabo Mbeki prepares to leave office.\n\nSouth African President Thabo Mbeki announced his resignation in a televised address Sunday.\n\nHis replacement, African National Congress Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe, will be sworn in as South Africa's president Thursday.\n\nMbeki announced he was resigning on Sunday, prompting threats from several Cabinet members to follow suit -- but the outgoing president urged them to stay in office, government sources said.\n\nThe resignations, which include Finance Minister Trevor Manuel and Defense Minister Mosiuoa Lekota, will take effect Thursday when Mbeki steps down, a government statement said.\n\n\"All the ministers have expressed their availability to assist the incoming administration in the hand-over process and any other assistance that might be sought from them,\" the statement said.\n\nThe finance minister's assistant told CNN that Manuel is willing to serve in the new government, if needed.\n\nThree deputy ministers have also tendered their resignations, a government statement said.\n\nA spokesman for South Africa's ruling party, the African National Congress, confirmed that it has named Motlanthe as its choice to succeed Mbeki. Motlanthe will stay in office until elections in the spring of next year, which ANC President Jacob Zuma is widely expected to win.\n\nEarlier this month, the ANC asked Mbeki to step down after a judge threw out the corruption, fraud and racketeering case against Zuma -- Mbeki's political arch rival. The judge called the case invalid and accused Mbeki's government of political interference.\n\nMbeki -- who has been South Africa's president for nearly 10 years -- spoke of some of his achievements when he formally announced his resignation on Sunday during a televised address.

Judge Chris Nicholson made no ruling on Zuma's guilt or innocence, and he could be recharged.\n\nPolitical observers doubted that would happen because of Zuma's popularity, particularly with the Communist Party and trade unions.\n\nZuma has denied the charges. He said the case was politically motivated, and harmed his chances to become the ANC's presidential nominee.\n\nHe could have faced at least 15 years in jail if convicted of accepting bribes from a company that got a contract in a multibillion-dollar arms deal.\n\nHe also faced charges of having a corrupt relationship with his former financial adviser, Schabir Shaik, who is serving a 15-year sentence for soliciting bribes for Zuma and using Zuma's political influence to benefit his businesses.\n\nMbeki, 66, succeeded Nelson Mandela as South Africa's president in June 1999.

They decided to use a surrogate to have a baby, because of the challenges a pregnancy could pose to her health.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the season finale, Arnold and Klein learned their surrogate was expecting. \"After we got pregnant, the craziness ensued with us wondering what to do with the baby's room, making sure our surrogate was getting her daily dose of baby vitamins,\" Klein tells PEOPLE.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut since filming their happy visit to the doctor, the couple's surrogate lost the pregnancy. Klein had to contact his wife, a neonatologist at Texas Children's Hospital, while she was at work in order to tell her the heartbreaking news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I didn't want her to be the last person to find out,\" he says. \"Ugly or happy, it needs to be told.

To avoid this, embryos are genetically tested before implantation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf no skeletal dysplasia genes are passed on, the baby would be healthy and average sized; if one gene is passed, the baby would be a healthy little person.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, Jen is on medication to stimulate her ovaries, which produced only half as many eggs as expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We appreciated all the prayers and positive thinking,\" says Arnold of sharing her difficult story with the world. \"That is comforting and is giving us strength. When we lost the pregnancy, we wondered how we were going to handle it.

This isn't different.\"\n\n\n\nShe said federal employees are able to take sick leave for \"anyone that was the close approximation of family\" and said the long-term-care option has been available for people under the same category. Polyak said not having health insurance from the federal government for her partner of 27 years costs her family $4,000 to $5,000 a year, not including co-pays or deductibles.\n\n\n\nAsked in a conference call with reporters whether these benefits were already available to same-sex partners of federal employees, Berry said such benefits are \"subject to the whim of a supervisor.\"\n\n\n\n\"If you have an enlightened supervisor, yes, that is a possibility (that they have been available),\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"What the president is doing today is making this no longer optional. He is making it mandatory. And he's making it clear that this is now the policy of the federal government.\"\n\n\n\nPolyak disagreed, saying, \"The idea that this was a fly-by-night [is] ... not true.

After all, it's the next logical step for the rogue state.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week, to advance the narrative that Arizona has no choice but to do its own immigration enforcement because the federal government is asleep at the switch, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer called for air support. Brewer requested helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles from the White House to patrol the border region with Mexico.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a letter to President Obama, Brewer asked that the National Guard reallocate reconnaissance helicopters and robotic surveillance craft to the \"border states\" to prevent illegal immigration. The governor also requested the deployment of unmanned drones, including possibly the Predator drones used in Iraq and Afghanistan. In fact, in her letter, Brewer even mentioned those foreign wars as examples of where the drones have been effective.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the matter with Arizona? Isn't it a little early in the year for the folks in the desert to be suffering from sunstroke?\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess this is par for the course. Brewer just signed SB 1070, a disgraceful anti-immigration and pro-racial-profiling law, to give local and state cops throughout the state the chance to suit up and play border patrol agent. Why shouldn't she get the chance to suit up and play general?\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all, like the United States, Arizona is currently involved in two wars. There's the hypocritical war against the very illegal immigrants that the state has spent the past 15 years providing with gainful employment by allowing them to do jobs that Arizonans wouldn't do. And then there's the rhetorical war with the Obama administration, which Arizona wants to portray as negligent in stopping illegal immigration, which forced Arizonans to take matters into their own hands.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe argument that the federal government isn't actively engaged in border enforcement is both dishonest and reckless.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is dishonest because it's not true. I've visited the U.S.-Mexico border a dozen times in the past 10 years: in Texas, Arizona and California. I've interviewed countless border patrol agents and supervisors. I've also been up in a Border Patrol helicopter flying above the border, which offers a unique perspective on border security.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I can tell you what the border patrol agents on the ground would tell you: The U.S.-Mexico border has never been more fortified. There are now more than 20,000 border patrol agents on the federal payroll. That's more agents than any other federal enforcement agency, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Those agents apprehend people and deport them at a feverish clip. In fact, it was recently announced that the Obama administration deported more people last year than the Bush administration during its final year in office.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is reckless because -- when this law is hauled before a federal judge, as it will be -- opponents will argue that the measure violates the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution by usurping federal authority to enforce immigration law. And that's the very thing that proponents seem to be admitting in their bravado. In fact, it might not be a bad idea for Arizona officials to pipe down and stop bragging about how they're doing the job of the federal government in terms of immigration enforcement, since that's a no-no under the Constitution.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the federal government does take border enforcement seriously, critics might ask: Why are there still people trying to enter the United States illegally? Simple. We can dig a moat, deploy an army, build walls or call in an airstrike, but desperate people will always find a way to go around, under or over any impediment in their path to a better life.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn't to condone illegal immigration. My views -- in support of deportations, workplace raids, giving more resources to the Border Patrol etc. -- are well known. I'm just telling you what Border Patrol agents tell me: that it doesn't make any sense to focus all our attention ", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- The international race am", "paragraphs": [{"context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- The international race among sailors, kite surfers and wind surfers to be the fastest wind-powered boat on the planet is rapidly gaining momentum as speeds reach all-time highs.\n\nQuick sailor: French trimaran l'Hydroptere is one of the boats battling for the outright world sailing speed record.\n\nThe outright world sailing speed record -- which did not change hands for 11 years after 1993 -- has been bettered four times this year alone.\n\nThe new holder of the record, Alexandre Caizergues, of France, claimed it with an average speed of 50.57 knots (almost 60 miles per hour) over 500 meters on his kite board off the coast of Namibia last month.\n\nCaizergues' attempt was eventually ratified by the World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC) this month, when it was decided that kite boards would be eligible for the outright record.\n\nMeanwhile, another Frenchman, Alain Thebault, has also been closely challenging for the record on his vessel l'Hydroptere.

This is called the United Nations General Assembly, and the decisions and resolutions that it makes set the agenda for a lot of what the U.N. works on throughout the year. One of the biggest focuses for this gathering is climate change. Secretary General Ban ki Moon calls it one of the most important issues of the 21st century. He's hoping that countries will work on ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which many scientists believe contribute to climate change.\n\n\n\nDuring speeches yesterday, President Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao, who lead the countries that give off the most greenhouse gases, pledged to try to reduce them. Neither leader offered a specific timeframe for this, but both said they plan to cut greenhouse gases and increase the use of clean energy sources.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama also touched on another controversial issue yesterday: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

But there's a cool little day trip from Denver that often gets overlooked by out-of-towners.\n\n\n\nThe Ski Train begins its round-trip journey to Winter Park at Union Station in Denver, Colorado.\n\n\n\nThe Ski Train is a 68-year-old local favorite that shuttles about 750 people between Denver and Winter Park. It runs on weekend days -- leaving Denver's Union Station at 7:15 a.m. -- and begins the return leg nine hours later.\n\n\n\nThe 56-mile trip takes about two hours each way, and many riders say it's worth the cost to avoid the traffic hassles of the oft-congested I-70.\n\n\n\nA roundtrip ticket costs between $49 and $85. There are additional expenses, such as parking at the train station in Denver and lift tickets for skiers. If someone chooses to shop instead of ski, a free shuttle into Winter Park is available.\n\n\n\nTrain riders love the trip route, which winds through the Rockies and climbs to 9,000 feet. It also travels through almost 30 tunnels, including the 6.2-mile Moffat Tunnel, which passes underneath the Continental Divide.\n\n\n\n\"The train ride up there is spectacular. You see wonderful vistas as you leave Denver through the northern plains and into the mountains,\" Kristal Kraft, a real estate agent in Denver, says. \"And once you get through the Moffat Tunnel, you're right there at Winter Park.\"\n\n\n\nKraft says she enjoyed her maiden voyage on the train, which came courtesy of a local home builder that bought group tickets in one of the club cars.\n\n\n\n\"I loved the convenience [of the train],' she says. \"We relaxed, talked, socialized. And when you get off the train, you are right there at the slopes.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to skitrain.com, three additional cars are available for charter and one for company retreats. The Web site lists the price for the presentation car at $5,000 for a winter trip. The site says the current train cars were purchased after Ansco Investment Company bought the Ski Train in 1988.\n\n\n\nKraft says the cars are comfortably heated and there is ample room to move around. Kraft, an amateur photography buff, enjoyed switching from window to window, side to side, to take pictures.\n\n\n\nThere is one occasional hitch to riding the train. It shares the track with the Union Pacific Railroad and at times has to stop or pullover to make way for a freight train or Amtrak. And there are instances where another train has an accident.\n\n\n\nOne time a coal train derailed in a tunnel and the Union Pacific officials told the Ski Train operators it would take two days to clear the tracks, says Ski Train media relations director Jim Bain.\n\n\n\nThey called the passengers together in a cafeteria in Winter Park and advised them to call friends and family to come pick them up. The company also arranged for a few buses to come gather the remaining passengers and Bain says they were all headed back to Denver by 8:30 p.m.\n\n\n\nIt was a worst-case scenario, he says, and it only happened once. There are occasional delays of a few hours.\n\n\n\nThe bad news is you're delayed; the good news is you're on a full service train with food service and restrooms. And there's the ability to find a beverage.\n\n\n\nOne reviewer on the Web site yelp.com said there's another bonus to the train.\n\n\n\n\"What's great is that once you get back into Denver you can hit Wynkoop brewery or any other bars around there to keep the party rolling,\" Ramon G. wrote.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry has iden", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry has identified the suicide bomber who attempted to assassinate the country's assistant interior minister last Thursday and released details of a phone conversation between the two men prior to the attack.\n\n\n\nA Saudi man reads a newspaper featuring a front-page story on Thursday's attack.\n\n\n\nThe disclosures reported by the country's official news agency were highly unusual.\n\n\n\nThe agency, SPA, reported the attacker, Abdullah Hassan Talea' Asiri, a wanted Saudi militant who had been hiding in Yemen, got in touch with Saudi authorities telling them he wanted to turn himself in to Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Naif, the assistant minister of Interior for Security Affairs.\n\n\n\nAfter arriving back in Saudi Arabia, Asiri spoke by phone to Mohammed, who agreed to see him during a Ramadan reception at his home in the city of Jeddah.\n\n\n\nAccording to a transcript provided by SPA, during the phone call the men exchanged greetings and discussed the importance of the holy month of Ramadan.\n\n\n\nMohammed is quoted as telling Asiri that \"one should be careful; evil people would like to exploit all of you. Now only you to fear Allah Almighty and come home.\" Later in the conversation, Asiri asked if a special plane could be dispatched to take him to meet with Mohammed.\n\n\n\nAsiri, escorted by security, was transported to Jeddah, where he met with the prince at his palace. During the meeting, Asiri explained to Mohammed that other Saudi militants in Yemen also wished to surrender but sought reassurances from the prince.\n\n\n\nAccording to SPA, a call was then placed to one of the militants in Yemen. While the prince was on the phone, Asiri blew himself up, SPA reported.\n\n\n\nMohammed, who is also the son of the country's Interior Minister, was lightly injured in the attack.\n\n\n\nSaudi King Abdullah was shown visiting the prince in the hospital after the attack on Saudi TV. The king asked the prince why the militant was allowed to get so close him without being inspected properly and searched thoroughly. Prince Mohammed answered the king by telling him it had been a mistake.\n\n\n\nSPA adds that \"the concerned security authorities opened an investigation into the incident. However, the criminal laboratory and a forensic report have reached conclusions that, for security considerations, will not be announced at this time.\"\n\n\n\nAsiri's name was on a list of 85 most wanted suspects released by Saudi Arabia in February. At the time the list was released, Saudi Arabia asked Interpol for its help in apprehending dozens of the wanted Saudis on the list who were suspected of plotting attacks against Saudi Arabia from abroad. The announcement was significant because it is rare for the kingdom to announce that some of its most wanted terrorists are on the loose. It is also unusual for Saudi Arabia to ask for help in finding them.\n\n\n\nSome of the suspects on the most wanted list had been released from Guantanamo Bay, returned to Saudi Arabia, and had then gone through a Jihadi reeducation program run by the Interior Ministry, before fleeing to Yemen and taking up terrorist activity once more.\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia has been battling terrorism since 2003, when al Qaeda launched a series of attacks inside the Kingdom. In the security crackdown that followed, Asiri, like many other wanted Saudi militants, fled to Yemen.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Saudi al Qaeda and Yemeni al Qaeda merged to form \"Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\"\n\n\n\nAl Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which operates out of Yemen, claimed responsibility earlier this week for the attack against Mohammed. In August, Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry announced that over the past year, 44 al Qaeda suspects across the country had been arrested.\n\n\n\nWhile the Interior Ministry is calling the attempted assassination an \"action of treachery and treason\", SPA reports that the Ministry will not change its \"open-door policy\" of granting amnesty to militants wishing to surrender - in particular, \"those citizens residing outside the country\" who wish to \"take advantage of the state-sponsored program of advice and care.\"", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- Nancy Reagan, wife of the late President ", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Nancy Reagan, wife of the late President Ronald Reagan, is hospitalized in California after suffering a broken pelvis, according to spokeswoman Joanne Drake.\n\n\n\nFormer first lady Nancy Reagan is shown at an event in the nation's capital in September.\n\n\n\nReagan, 87, is in the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, Drake said in a written statement Wednesday.\n\n\n\nThe former first lady fell last week at her home, Drake said, but admitted herself to the hospital only after experiencing \"persistent pain.\" Tests revealed a fractured pelvis and sacrum -- the triangular bone within the pelvis.\n\n\n\nReagan will remain hospitalized for a few days until \"doctors are satisfied with her progress,\" Drake said.

Orchids have been a source of passion since the beginning of time. Rin Tin Tin has been beloved and admired and dreamed about for nearly a hundred years. The dog and the orchids are both things that very disparate and sometimes unlikely people come together over.\n\n\n\n\n\nOprah.com: 33 fall must-reads\n\n\n\n\n\nQ.

I'm conscious of how readers will feel following a story when they might have started out thinking, I can't believe I'm reading a book about a TV dog. Where I hope you end up is: Oh wow, this is an amazing story and I never thought about the culture this way. Or I didn't know dogs had weddings in the late 1800s. I just hope that people will get excited about learning all these things the way I did when I was writing.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ. What's the biggest misconception people have about Rin Tin Tin?\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Either that there was only one dog -- who miraculously lived for 80 or so years, I guess! -- or the exact opposite: that there was no real dog, just a character.\n\n\n\n\n\nOprah.com: Middle-school girls give stray dogs a second chance\n\n\n\n\n\nQ.

People want to, if not live forever, have evidence of their existence live forever. And I think that part of what happened for me was that my dad died in the course of my writing this, and I started thinking about memory, the idea that things come and go and then they're gone and forgotten. But Rin Tin Tin, by being reinvented over and over in people's imaginations, became kind of a timeless model: He just keeps going and going; his story outlives everybody.

I have no statistics to back this up, but my guess is that Rin Tin Tin had more boy fans and Lassie more girl fans; after all, Lassie was female, supposedly, and the setting of her story was more domestic, including a mother, whereas Rin Tin Tin was definitely male, living in an all-male world.

Others are expected to be seen in coming decades.\n\nThere are two ways to look at this: Either stay home (which might be less depressing and won't add more airline emissions) or get a move on it and see the hot spots you just can't miss.\n\nFor those who want to head out, CNN got advice on the best pre-warming travel destinations from Bob Henson, author of \"The Rough Guide to Climate Change\" and a writer at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nHere are Henson's top five choices:\n\nGreat Barrier Reef, Australia\n\nWarming temperatures can spell disaster for coral reefs, which depend on a delicate balance of ocean temperature and chemistry to bloom into colorful displays.\n\nMany of the world's reefs already are experiencing \"bleaching\" in which algae living in the coral die and leave behind whitened skeletons.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef -- which is composed of about 2,900 individual reefs and is off the northeast coast of Australia -- is seeing limited bleaching now, and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority expects the problem to grow in coming decades.\n\nHenson said the reefs' colorful displays are not to be missed.\n\n\"It's a feast for the eyes in terms of color, texture variations -- it's just amazing to see,\" he said. \"It's wonderful to be enveloped in the warm water and look down just a few feet below at this amazing spread of ocean life.\"\n\nBoats of people with snorkels typically launch into the reefs from Cairns, Queensland. If you go, tread lightly, Henson said. Visitors can damage the reefs if they get too close.\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\n\nHow much sea levels will rise as the world warms is one of the trickiest parts of the climate change equation. If huge hunks of ice -- such as parts of Greenland and the western shelf of Antarctica -- melt, then the rise is expected to be more dramatic.\n\n\"Nobody knows whether they're going to completely melt or not, but we do know it's not going to happen in the next 10 years,\" Henson said.\n\nBut for cities near the coast such as New Orleans, which already sits below sea level, rising waters could spell trouble for tourists and residents alike, even in the relative near term.\n\n\"In the next several hundred years, life there may be difficult, and the cities may become impractical unless we can build large structures to keep the waters at bay,\" he said.\n\nHenson doesn't expect New Orleans to be underwater anytime soon. But travel to the Louisiana city may become more difficult in the future, he said. Scientists expect floods to become more frequent.\n\n\"It's sobering to be in New Orleans and look up at the levees that sit above you and keep out the Mississippi River,\" he said. \"You're standing below the level of the river, looking up.\"\n\nRocky Mountain National Park, Estes Park, Colorado\n\nHerds of tiny pine beetles are munching away at Colorado's forests, turning the evergreens a sickly red and destroying large patches of trees.\n\nCold snaps -- which, in mountain terms, mean about five nights of minus-30 temperatures -- usually kill off the native beetles. But winters are warming, and Henson and others said they worry the beetles can't be stopped.\n\nThe beetle infestation \"has reached epidemic proportions as a result of climate issues,\" said Kyle Patterson, spokeswoman for the Rocky Mountain National Park.\n\nThe beetles are causing problems all over America's mountainous west, but the issue is particularly visible at Patterson's park, northwest of Denver.

The fact is, Miami is no longer the same city as the one portrayed in the 1980s cop show.\n\n\n\nParty time in Little Havana.\n\n\n\nThe expansive sandy beaches are still there, as is the surfeit of sunshine, the hint of the exotic and the hordes of sun-hungry tourists who have flocked to this holiday hotspot for the last 80 years. But Miami has shed much of its unwanted baggage from the 80s and has grown beyond a resort town into something more substantial.\n\n\n\nStill barely 100 years old, Miami was a tourist destination almost from its inception. The offshore sandbar called Miami Beach was quickly recognized as having all the ingredients of a world-class holiday resort and the hotel-building spree that took place in the 1920s and 30s has left Miami Beach with hundreds of stunning Art Deco structures that give the area its distinctive look\n\n\n\nBy the 1980s, as well as being the destination of choice for holiday makers, retirees and 'snowbirds' (Canadians and northern Americans wintering in Florida), Miami had attracted an uninvited guest -- the 'cocaine cowboy.' Miami's proximity to South America made it a key point of entry for Colombian cocaine smugglers and the city became a battleground for ruthless drug barons intent on grabbing their piece of the American Dream.\n\n\n\nThe mid 80s was the Miami Vice era, when the city's reputation for glamour and hedonism came with a side order of carjackings and gangland shootouts. But by the mid 90s, Miami had largely driven the cocaine cowboys out of town and hoteliers like Ian Schrager began converting some of those Art Deco classics into sophisticated boutique hotels fit for the international jet set. The guns may have gone but the glitz was never far away.\n\n\n\nNow that Miami's been to rehab and come out cleaned up and healthy, it turns out there's more to the city than glitzy nightclubs and the surgically enhanced bodies of the beautiful people. Miami has acquired a reputation as the new kid on the block in the modern art scene, a reputation that was cemented when the world's most prestigious modern art fair, Art Basel, arrived in the city in 2002.\n\n\n\nJust like the snowbirds, Art Basel returns to Miami each winter and the Wynwood neighborhood has now become a bona fide art district, with exclusive galleries showcasing cutting-edge art all year round. Nearby, the Design District is full of studios and workshops producing contemporary furniture and art.\n\n\n\nThen there's the fact that Miami is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world, with some 60% of the population born outside the U.S. The food, music, culture and language of Latin America have all become part of modern Miami, giving the city a cultural heritage that belies its youth.\n\n\n\nBut don't think Miami's reinvention as a cultural destination has done anything to dent it's appetite for the good times. When it comes to partying, there's not many places that can keep up with Miami, and even fewer that can do it with as much style. In truth, there's still a touch of the old Vice about Miami, and who knows, with the 80s revival, we may not have seen the last of those white suits.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- Police in Milwaukee are working to track ", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Police in Milwaukee are working to track down a serial killer linked to at least seven unsolved homicides dating back more than two decades, authorities said.\n\n\n\nFive victims (clockwise from top left): Debora Harris, Joyce Mims, Tonya Miller, Quithreaun Stokes, Sheila Farrior.\n\n\n\nLaw enforcement officials in the Wisconsin city have matched the unknown man's DNA with seven women -- six prostitutes and a runaway involved in the drug trade.

Everything he had -- money, fame, budding TV career, marriage, friends, respect -- all lost because of the horrible decisions he made one fateful night.\n\n\n\n\n\nJayson Williams didn't achieve the level of fame as Tiger Woods, but we can surely learn more from his fall from grace than Tiger's.

But the financial traffic is by no means one-way. In the other direction, Steven Spielberg's Dreamworks recently snagged a multi-million dollar film production deal with Reliance Big Entertainment, one of Bollywood's biggest hitters.\n\n\n\nFor Kumar, the strengthening of ties between Hollywood and Bollywood is bringing many opportunities, including the chance to work alongside his childhood hero Stallone. \"Well it was great.

(Warner Brothers, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.)\n\n\n\nThe typically flamboyant plot of \"Chandni Chowk\" was loosely inspired by Kumar's own life. Born in Punjab but raised in Delhi, he came to acting late after working as a waiter in Bangkok. While in the Thai capital he learned martial arts, which he taught upon his return to India before becoming a male model.\n\n\n\nHe landed his first movie role in the 1992 Hindi language film \"Deeder\" and has gone on to become one of Bollywood's leading men. He is married to fellow actor Twinkle Khanna. The couple created a buzz in India when they fell foul of the country's notoriously strict obscenity laws in March after Kumar encouraged his wife to undo the top button of his jeans at a fashion show in Mumbai. A complaint was lodged with the police and they were briefly questioned.\n\n\n\nWith more than 80 features to his name, Kumar maintains that a strong work ethic is the reason for his longevity in the movie business. \"I think it's the simplest thing.

In short, there's nothing to worry about with an airline like American, but I thought it would be a good idea to devote this week's column to the issue since it's at the top of mind for many travelers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWill American go bankrupt? I'm certainly not qualified to answer that question. Only the airline itself knows its plans, but the balance sheet certainly doesn't point to bankruptcy being necessary in the short to medium term.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, American has been losing money recently while others have profited, but at the end of June, it had more than $5 billion in the bank and it has been able to arrange financing since then. That doesn't sound like a company that would be filing for bankruptcy protection, which should be a last resort. Even if it does for some strategic reason, flights wouldn't be affected.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, it's worth talking about what to do when an airline goes bankrupt, because airlines around the world shut down every year. It's always good to know what you can do. Here is some advice.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways pay with a credit card\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you buy a ticket, you might be paying for something (a flight, presumably) that you won't use for another year. That's a long time for an airline to hold on to your money, and that's why you should pay with a credit card.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you buy a ticket with a credit card, then you won't be on the hook if your airline goes under. In fact, when airlines start to find themselves in financial trouble, credit card processors hold back a larger and larger percentage of the money until the flight occurs. That way, if the airline doesn't perform, the credit card company still has your money and can give it right back to you.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeriodically check in on your airline\n\n\n\n\n\nIt sounds silly when you're talking about an airline like American, because you would know instantly if it filed for bankruptcy protection.

Probably not.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo if you do find yourself booked on an airline that might not be very well known here in the U.S., it can't hurt to check in every so often to make sure it's still flying. Most airlines with websites are very good at letting you know when they go out of business.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven better, you can set up an alert via Google that will send you a note anytime an airline's name pops up in the news. This is hardly necessary for the better-known airlines around the world, of course, but it's a good idea for smaller airlines that you want to keep an eye on.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave a backup plan\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're worried about an airline going out of business for one reason or another, have a mental backup plan waiting in case you need to spring into action. Find out what other airlines fly where you need to go, and be ready to try to pounce if something happens. If you're prepared, you'll be able to get that last seat on your alternate before someone else who was unprepared even knows what's happening. But you'll still have to pay for it.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't expect help from other airlines\n\n\n\n\n\nThere used to be a rule in the U.S. that other airlines had to honor tickets on failed airlines for a nominal fee. That doesn't exist anymore, so don't go looking for charity from other airlines if yours goes under.

Equally significant, the ruling came after a lengthy televised trial, which was clearly fair to the defendant -- despite Peru's previous history of authoritarianism and weak rule of law.\n\nFujimori came to office in 1990 on the promise of crushing a vicious Maoist insurgency but, in the process of restoring order, he corrupted and weakened Peru's most vital government institutions -- including parliament, the courts and law enforcement. Just a few years ago, Fujimori had near-total control of Peru's judiciary.\n\nFor a decade, his government used bribery, extortion, and intimidation to concentrate power in the presidency, subverting the democratic process and eliminating normal checks by the judiciary, legislature, and media on government abuses.\n\nHe led Peru from 1990 to 2000, presiding over the war with the Shining Path guerrillas and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. He was convicted of authorizing killings and kidnappings by paramilitary death squads. Fujimori is to be tried separately on multiple corruption charges.\n\nThe landmark decision fits within a global trend of increasing accountability for former heads of state. Just 20 years ago, it was exceedingly rare for even the most brutal leaders to be brought to book. In the late 20th century, Mao Zedong, Idi Amin, Milton Obote, Ferdinand Marcos, Anastasio Somoza, Jean-Claude \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier and Mobutu Sese Seko, to name just a few, were never brought to trial.\n\nSince then, however, the tide has turned. In October 1998, London police arrested General Augusto Pinochet on a warrant from a Spanish judge for human rights crimes. The arrest and the subsequent decisions by the British House of Lords to reject Pinochet's claim of immunity were a wake-up call to tyrants everywhere, but more important, they gave hope to victims elsewhere that they too could bring their tormentors to justice.\n\nIn country after country, particularly in Latin America, victims were inspired to challenge the amnesty laws of the 1980s and 1990s that had allowed the perpetrators of atrocities to go unpunished and, often, to remain in power. Thanks to these efforts, former leaders in Argentina, and Uruguay have also faced human rights trials.\n\nPinochet's arrest also strengthened a nascent international movement -- spurred by the killings in Bosnia and Rwanda, and facilitated by the end of the Cold War -- to make certain the worst abuses are punished.\n\nAfter the creation of UN tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the world established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and serious war crimes when national courts are unable or unwilling to do so.\n\nThe ICC is now investigating crimes in the Central African Republic, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in March the court indicted President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan on charges of crimes against humanity in Darfur.\n\nThe Fujimori case stands out, though, because it was Peru's national court system which demonstrated the will, capacity, and independence to try its former president.\n\nA second panel of the Supreme Court will now review an appeal by Fujimori.

It receives a great deal of attention in our national discourse and should receive more.\n\n\n\n\n\nTest scores and graduation rates are improving faster in other nations than in the United States and this threatens our quality of life in a competitive world.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, achievement gaps between racial groups in the United States remain large. The social and political vitality of the nation may depend on closing these racial gaps. Blacks and Hispanics are doing better than in the past compared to whites, but still not nearly good enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking schools better should be only one part of our national strategy. Life at home has been a relatively neglected topic and needs to come out of the shadows.\n\n\n\n\n\nEspecially in churches, neighborhood organizations, families and informal social networks, helping parents do their best needs to be as big a priority as achieving excellent schools.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis goes beyond public policies. I am talking about changes in mindsets and lifestyles in a national social and cultural movement to close achievement gaps between groups -- a movement to achieve excellence with equity.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore reading at home is a place to start. I present data in my recent book based on a large sample of students in elementary and secondary schools from several states.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack and Hispanic students reported less leisure reading at home compared to whites, watched television more, were much more likely to have televisions in their bedrooms and (perhaps as a consequence) were more prone to become sleepy at school. Also, blacks and Hispanics, including those with college-educated parents, reported fewer books in their homes than whites whose parents had fewer years of schooling.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, life at home helps shape academic outcomes long before children begin reading books. Family-level supports in the first two years of life help predict achievement years later, in elementary school.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeginning soon after birth, the most supportive mothers teach the joy of living and learning, through lots of active, encouraging, verbal and nonverbal communication. They engage actively in helping children learn to walk and talk and to explore their new world and manipulate their toys and other objects.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch mothers exist in large numbers in every racial group. Nonetheless, in a recent study by Harvard's Richard Murnane and co-authors, differences in mother-child interaction patterns like these were found to account for one-third of the black-white gap in math and English skills at the beginning of kindergarten -- and one-quarter at the end of third grade.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs children get older, highly responsive parents spend time with children, look for ways to be helpful and encourage them to voice their opinions. They are good listeners and they teach their children that they have a right to be heard and that people in positions of authority can sometimes be persuaded. The same parents can also be demanding, providing rules and structure and holding children consistently accountable for their behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Jelani Mandara of Northwestern University found in a nationally representative sample that students who achieved the highest test scores among blacks, Hispanics and whites had parents who were both responsive and demanding.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the study, white parents were much more likely to be both responsive and demanding than black and Hispanic parents; whereas black parents, in particular, were often highly demanding, but tended not to be as responsive in the ways the study measured. Among early adolescents, differences along these dimensions helped account for the higher test scores of whites as compared with blacks and Hispanics.\n\n\n\n\n\nFindings like the above should be part of the conversation among black and Hispanic ", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- John Spieker stood on the back porch of h", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- John Spieker stood on the back porch of his newly rented Bailey, Colorado, home, thankful for his Good Samaritan landlord and worried that his previous home, parked in the driveway, wouldn't get him to work the next day.\n\n\n\nJohn and Katie Spieker stand next to their camper with baby son, Jacob.\n\n\n\nHis 1977 Toyota Dolphin camper, which Spieker rescued from a salvage yard, had carried him, his wife, Katie, and 4-month-old son, Jacob, from Florida to Colorado earlier this summer, a cross-country sojourn in search of work.\n\n\n\nHe was uncertain it could handle the 14-mile commute the next morning, but he'd make do.\n\n\n\n\"I'm gonna get up extra early every morning like I have been, and if it [the camper] doesn't get to work, I'm gonna hitchhike,\" Spieker said last week. \"I have a wife and a son to support.\"\n\n\n\nSpieker had been making $12 an hour plus commission at his information technology job in Trenton, Florida.

Office on Drugs and Crime, urged NATO to take a more active role in countering the spread of the drug trade, which has increased dramatically since the American-led invasion to remove the hard-line Islamist government of the Taliban in October 2001.\n\n\"Since drugs are funding the insurgency, NATO has a self-interest in supporting Afghan forces in destroying drug labs, markets and convoys,\" Costa said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey. \"Destroy the drug trade and you cut off the Taliban's main funding source.\"\n\nJames Appathurai, a NATO spokesman, said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade.\n\n\"We share the U.N.'s concerns,\" Appathurai told CNN. \"Drugs not only poison people, but they poison economies and governments, and it is in everyone's interest to stop this proliferation.\"\n\nHe said NATO forces were providing assistance to Afghan police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly.\n\n\"The issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for NATO, but at the moment this is a matter for the Afghan government,\" Appathurai said.\n\nFarming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country, Appathurai said.\n\nHowever, he said, in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the Taliban stronghold of Helmand, poppy production was going on largely unchecked.\n\nAccording to the report, U.N. observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes.\n\nCosta said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals, like acetic anhydride, that must be smuggled into the region.\n\nHe called for tighter controls in chemical-producing countries and stronger intelligence-sharing between Afghanistan and its neighbors.\n\n\"Drug trafficking is a transnational threat, and therefore national initiatives have their limitations,\" the U.N. drug chief said.\n\nAppathurai said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency head-on. He also said it was important to provide alternative work for poor Afghan farmers to encourage them to give up opium production.\n\n\"You cannot have eradication in isolation. If we don't give them the support to produce alternative crops, then by wiping out their opium fields, you are only creating enemies for the future,\" he said.

She had been shot in the mouth. A .38-caliber Colt Special revolver lay at her feet.

Spector's driver testified he heard a loud noise and saw the producer leave the home, pistol in hand, saying, \"I think I killed somebody.\"\n\n\n\nAt issue was whether Spector pulled the trigger -- or whether Clarkson did.

I found Iran to be perhaps the most misunderstood and fascinating land I've ever visited. And I learned a lot.\n\nThe country is not free. It seems that people -- motivated by fear of Western influences and love of their children -- have forgone democracy for their theocracy. Parents told me, \"We do not want our girls to grow up to be Britney Spears,\" and they are willing to sacrifice some freedom to achieve that goal. They feel their \"revolution of values\" provides an environment where they can raise their children free from the cheap sex, drug abuse and crass materialism of the West.\n\nIranian women must wear a scarf, but many leave a tuft of hair showing at the forehead. After several days, that provocative tuft attracted my eye like cleavage. Making sure that what they can show is as beautiful as possible, Iranian women, per capita, lead the world in nose jobs. Faces are beautifully made up, and -- when so much else is covered -- can be particularly expressive and mysterious. Eye contact is riveting.\n\nBefore arriving in Iran, I was so afraid of anti-Americanism that we had nearly left our big expensive TV camera in Athens and considered flying in with a less obtrusive model. But once there, I found people curious, courteous and quick to smile -- especially when they learned we were American. I've never had such fun with people or found them so chatty than on the streets of Iran.\n\nTehran is modern and bustling, with thriving shopping malls, cars clogging the streets and most people wearing Western-style clothes. Unlike many Muslim capitals, minarets do not dot the skyline, and I barely heard a call to prayer.\n\nAnd yet it's clearly a theocracy. Multiple TV stations broadcast religious programming (along with BBC and CNN) that's perfect for praying -- images of the sun setting on the sea, or the pilgrimage center in Mecca in real-time. In the United States, billboards and ads encourage us to consume, but in Iran, government-sponsored billboards, Muzak and TV programming is all about the teachings of great holy men.\n\nI asked my guide if it's okay to be non-Muslim in Iran. \"Yes,\" he said, \"We have religious freedom, as long as it is not offensive to Islam.\" Christian? \"Sure.\" Jewish? \"Sure.\" Bahai? \"No. We believe that Mohammed -- who came in the 7th century -- was the last prophet, so the Bahai prophet (19th century) is offensive to Islam.\"\n\nI asked, \"What if you want to get somewhere in the military or government?\"\n\nMy guide answered, \"Then you better be a Muslim -- a practicing, Shiite Muslim.\"\n\nEvery film crew stops at the former U.S. Embassy. It was here in 1979 that a gang of revolutionary students stormed what they called the \"Den of Spies\" and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. For Iranians back then, it was a proud moment of triumph against the nation that had meddled in their affairs for years. The embassy wall is still covered with anti-American murals painted at that time. But the hostage crisis was 30 years ago. Most Iranians weren't even born then.

The Danish provocateur twice won prestigious honors at the Cannes Film Festival (with \"Breaking the Waves\" and \"Dancer in the Dark\") and re-energized European art cinema in the 1990s with the Dogme movement's so-called \"Vows of Chastity.\"\n\n\n\nIt's not often that an art-house director takes up the implements to make a horror film, and for a while, \"Antichrist\" compels with its anguished intensity and audacious stylistic choices, not least the severity that keeps the focus exclusively on this man and woman, neither of whom is named.\n\n\n\nThe prologue -- the child's death -- is a luxurious, slow-motion rhapsody of explicit sex, black-and-white photography and baroque music, commingling with the infant's almost ersatz tragedy and finding perfunctory counterpoint in banal close-ups of the family's washer-dryer. (There may be a deliberate echo here of the famous sex scene in Nicolas Roeg's \"Don't Look Now,\" a far more keenly calibrated examination of grief succumbing to the supernatural.)\n\n\n\nDafoe and Gainsbourg are riveting as the ill-matched couple. He's an implacable rationalist, urging her to confront her fears and venture into the darkest recesses of her psyche. She's not sure he's ready to share that torment with her. Their bitter, sometimes sourly funny back-and-forth fleetingly echoes the railing, pugnacious and remorseful men and women we find again and again in Strindberg and Bergman.\n\n\n\nOf course, when those great Scandinavian dramatists wanted to shock us with the ferocity of the battle of the sexes and show a married couple going at it tooth and nail, their only weapons were words. Mindful that he's up against \"Hostel,\" \"Saw\" and the like, Herr von Trier ups the ante considerably.\n\n\n\nHiking to a log cabin in the mountains to uncover the apex of his wife's fears (it could be anywhere, but let's imagine we're in the neighborhood of Burkittsville), the doctor's little experiment in exposure therapy ends in crushed genitals and, uh, worse. Much worse.\n\n\n\nIt's safe to say von Trier knows this climax is over the top: \"Chaos reigns!\" announces a fox, in perfect English, just as the movie goes off the deep end. Chaos reigns all right, and Gainsbourg's traumatized mom is transformed nonsensically into a raving psycho witch-bitch.\n\n\n\nThis director has often been accused of misogyny for the punishments that befall his heroines -- spuriously, in my opinion. But this time the boot is on the other foot, and for once the charge seems to stick; no matter that the first half of the movie suggests Dafoe's smug therapist is due for a comeuppance.\n\n\n\nApparently someone had a seizure when the movie showed at the New York Film Festival recently. When I caught up with it at the Vancouver International Film Festival two weeks ago, the screening was punctuated with the single loudest shriek I've ever heard in the theatre -- that would have been when Gainsbourg gets out the scissors for a spot of ad hoc auto-surgery.

He'd built an organization strong enough to haul supporters out of their homes on a frigid January night to debate, harangue and cajole their neighbors into backing him. Tens of thousands of new voters became the key to his Iowa win and revealed the outline of a general election plan: Create a wide coalition to bring new voters to the polls in record numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nTed Kennedy: Within weeks of Iowa, all of Obama's Democratic competitors had dropped out of the race except for Clinton, who split the races with him in the run-up to Super Tuesday. It was then that Ted Kennedy, head of the only Democratic family to outrank the Clintons, came out for Obama, comparing the Illinois senator to his assassinated brother, President John F. Kennedy. The move was deeply symbolic, not just for the public but also the party. The Obama-Clinton battle then hinged on who could sway more superdelegates -- the party leaders who could decide the winner if the primary voters could not -- and few superdelegates had the stature of Ted Kennedy.\n\n\n\n\n\nAddressing race: Race was always going to be a factor in Obama's campaign, even if he hoped his candidacy would transcend it. Clips of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, his longtime pastor, making hateful remarks hit the Internet and television and put Obama on defense. He responded with a speech in March hailed by commentators as among the most thoughtful ever delivered on race by an American politician. When Wright went further, so did Obama -- condemning him outright and later quitting his church. All this time, black voters were rallying behind Obama, switching their allegiance from Clinton in such large numbers that party elders, such as civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, had to do the same.\n\n\n\n\n\nFundraising: Flush with cash from a nationwide network of small and large contributors, Obama announced in June he would opt out of public financing -- the first presidential candidate to pay for his campaign with donations rather than government money since the system began in 1976. McCain hammered Obama for reneging on a promise to stick with public financing, but the issue failed to resonate with voters. Obama kept raising and spending record amounts of money, using it to send staff across the country -- even to dozens of states Democrats hadn't won in years -- and to swamp the airwaves with advertising.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with Clinton: The long and bitter primary battle turned many Clinton supporters off Obama. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll a month after Obama sealed the nomination found that nearly 50 percent of Clinton's supporters did not plan to vote for Obama in November. McCain tried to exploit the Democrats' divisions and attract Clinton supporters to his side, but the former rivals came together to stop that.

Immediately, their minds turned to their 7-year-old daughter, Morgan, who was upstairs getting ready for bed.\n\n\n\nAn injured Morgan McCracken has benefited from awareness after Natasha Richardson's death.\n\n\n\nTwo days earlier, Morgan, her father, and brother had been playing baseball in the yard of their Mentor, Ohio, home when her father hit a line drive that landed just above Morgan's left temple. A lump formed, but the McCrackens iced it down and the swelling subsided within an hour.\n\n\n\n\"For the next two days, she was perfectly fine,\" Donald McCracken says. \"She had no symptoms. She went to school both days and got an A on her spelling test as usual. There were no issues whatsoever.\"\n\n\n\nBut after hearing about Richardson's death, the McCrackens wondered if Morgan was really as OK as she seemed. After all, Richardson had been talking and lucid immediately after her fatal injury.\n\n\n\nWhen they went upstairs to kiss Morgan good night, she complained of a headache. \"Because of Natasha, we called the pediatrician immediately. And by the time I got off the phone with him, Morgan was sobbing, her head hurt so much,\" McCracken says.\n\n\n\nThe McCrackens took Morgan to the emergency room at LakeWest Hospital in neighboring Willoughby, where doctors ordered a CT scan and immediately put Morgan on a helicopter to Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, with her father by her side.\n\n\n\n\"I knew it was bad when she had to get there by helicopter in six minutes, instead of the 30 minutes it would have taken to get to Cleveland in an ambulance,\" McCracken said.\n\n\n\nWhen the helicopter arrived at Rainbow, the McCrackens were greeted by Dr. Alan Cohen, the hospital's chief of pediatric neurosurgery. He whisked Morgan into the operating room, pausing for a moment to tell McCracken that his daughter had the same injury as Richardson: an epidural hematoma.\n\n\n\nMcCracken remembers standing in the emergency room, feeling like the life had just been sucked out of him. \"My heart sank,\" he says. \"It just sank.\"\n\n\n\nUnlike Richardson's, Morgan's story has a happy ending. After surgery and five days in the hospital, she's at home and doing fine. \"Dr. Cohen told us that if we hadn't brought her in Thursday night, she never would have woken up,\" McCracken says.\n\n\n\nNow the McCrackens sometimes wonder if they waited too long to get Morgan to a doctor. After hearing about Richardson's death, many people are asking themselves the same question: Do all head injuries need attention, even ones that seem minor?\n\n\n\n\"Sometimes there's a gray zone, and there's no right answer,\" Cohen says.  Watch for tips on when to go to the ER \u00bb\n\n\n\nIn most cases, it's pretty clear when someone needs medical attention after a head injury, says Greg Ayotte, a spokesperson for the Brain Injury Association of America and a cognitive rehabilitation therapist. \"They're confused, they're agitated, or they might be dizzy or unresponsive,\" he says.\n\n\n\nBut then there's what doctors call the \"talk and die\" scenario, where someone seems fine, only to die hours, or sometimes even days later.\n\n\n\n\"Talk and die\" can happen with several different kinds of brain injuries. In the case of epidural hematomas, the injury Richardson and Morgan had, blood pools in the area between the lining of the brain and the skull. \"Fluid is building up in a contained space, creating pressure. Something's got to give, and that something is the brain,\" Ayotte says. If you don't get to the hospital to have surgery to drain the fluid, \"the deterioration can happen very quickly.\"\n\n\n\nHere, from Ayotte and other experts, is a list of what to do after someone has suffered a head injury.\n\n\n\n1.

Martin says Lifeway Christian Stores should be given hell for its actions against GospelToday.\n\n\n\n(CNN) -- In the 19 years that Teresa Hairston has published her magazine, GospelToday, she has never faced a major situation with Christian bookstores across the country that carry the publication.\n\n\n\nShe's tackled any number of issues over the years,and has featured a number of celebrities and ministers, ranging from Yolanda Adams to Bishop T.D. Jakes to Kirk Franklin.\n\n\n\nBut when the Atlanta, Georgia, entrepreneur decided to feature five female pastors on her cover this month, she says, Lifeway Christian Stores treated her like she had converted her Christian publication to something akin to the tastes of porn purveyor Larry Flynt.\n\n\n\nApparently, the owner of Lifeway, the Southern Baptist Convention, wasn't too happy with Hairston telling the story of female pastors, because the women go against their 2000 decree that only men can serve in the role of reverend or pastor.\n\n\n\nAccording to Hairston, the Christian company didn't even give her the courtesy of a heads-up.\n\n\n\n\"We got an anonymous tip,\" she told me Tuesday on The Tom Joyner Morning Show, and after checking it out, she discovered that the magazine had been removed from the shelves in all of Lifeway's 100-plus stores nationwide and had been placed behind the counter.\n\n\n\n\"They have never called me,\" Hairston said. \"Never sent an e-mail. Nothing. I had to go see my distributor to verify what they had done.\"\n\n\n\nThe actions of Lifeway didn't stun me. I had seen this movie before.\n\n\n\nA few years ago, my wife was a longtime Lifeway teacher. She had taught at the company's teaching centers for years, but then one day, she was notified that she would have to take down her Web site and comply with their rules against female pastors or be dropped as a teacher. Her crime? Calling herself the Rev. Jacquie Hood Martin.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't that she did so for the heck of it. She graduated from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary; was the first female staff pastor at Houston's Brookhollow Baptist Church/the Church Without Walls, a Southern Baptist Convention church; and has been leading folks to the Lord all over the country for 20 years.\n\n\n\nShe was angered by Lifeway's decision but made it clear that she didn't serve the bookstore or even the Southern Baptist Convention. She made a commitment to serving Jesus Christ and was not about to back away from her call to ministry because a male-dominated organization decided that its interpretation of the Bible calls for a woman not to be in the pulpit.\n\n\n\nSo she cut them off and kept on calling herself the Rev. Jacquie Hood Martin.\n\n\n\nReligious folks will quickly say that Scripture is clear that women can't be pastors and lead men, yet Hairston says that when she featured Pastor Paula White on her cover two years ago, Lifeway didn't take any action against the magazine.\n\n\n\nAnyone who has served in a church or been a member of any faith knows that there are those who have strict interpretations of their faith's writings, while others have a different interpretation.\n\n\n\nI've heard Brookhollow's pastor, the Rev.

Bobby Jindal on Barack Obama: \"I'm certainly not nearly as good of a speaker as he is.\"\n\nJindal gave the Republican response after President Obama's address to Congress last week. Jindal received negative reviews after the speech, and Larry asked him how he felt about that. They also talked about the war of words in the Republican Party centered around Rush Limbaugh.\n\nThe following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity:\n\nLarry King: Governor, you took a lot of flak for that speech. Were you surprised that you did?\n\nGov. Bobby Jindal: Let's be clear, the president is a great speaker -- probably the greatest we've seen in a generation. I'm certainly not nearly as good of a speaker as he is. And I'm not the only one that's got that opinion.\n\nI hope people look at the content of the speech, not just the delivery. You know, for years, I've been told I speak too quickly. Now I'm told I speak too slowly.\n\nWhat's more important is I was outlining a philosophical difference with the stimulus package, with the leadership in Congress, with the administration. I was outlining a philosophical disagreement that says we need to get businesses hiring again. We need to put more money in the private sector.  Watch Larry King's interview with Gov. Bobby Jindal \u00c2\u00bb\n\nLet's cut taxes. Let's get rid of the wasteful spending. That's the debate. That's the discussion we need to be having.\n\nKing: But governor, to say that the federal government apparently has no voice in this crisis, when in some cases, they are the only answer, that pointed to a lot of the criticism, didn't it?\n\nJindal: If the president had actually delivered the targeted temporary stimulus package that he described, I think you'd see a lot more conservative and Republican support. We absolutely agree with the kind of infrastructure spending he describes -- speeding up federal spending that would have happened anyway.\n\nLess than 5 percent of this bill was actually [for] the shovel-ready infrastructure spending that he described.  ...\n\nFundamentally, I don't think $30 million for the federal government to buy new cars, $1 billion for the Census, $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts is going to get the economy moving again as quickly as allowing the private sector to create jobs.\n\nKing: There was no criticism of the Bush bailout of the automobile industry. No criticism of the last eight years of the Republican leadership with a tremendous deficit.\n\nJindal: Well, Larry, I think that you're absolutely right. One of the reasons the Republicans lost the elections in 2006 and 2008 is the Republican Party didn't match its actions with its rhetoric. ...\n\nI think one of the reasons we lost elections was that the Republicans came to Washington to change the culture and instead became captive of that culture. The Republican Party defended spending and corruption we never would have accepted from the other side.\n\nKing: Governor, if perception is reality, do you think your speech hurt the party?\n\nJindal: I think that people are going to look at the content. I think people are going to be focused now that we've [got] alternative views on how to move our country forward.\n\nLet me begin the first to say we want to work with the president every chance we can get. Whenever we can find areas of agreement, we need to work across the aisle and put America first.\n\nBut when we disagree, we need to offer principled alternative solutions. So for example, in health care, I agree with the president that health care should be affordable for every American. I just don't think it should be a government-run program.\n\nKing: All right, governor, here was Rush Limbaugh at this weekend's CPAC Conference.

There really is no good explanation of why that's the case.\"\n\n\n\nSix of the 15 lightning-strike deaths in the U.S. so far this year occurred in California, Texas and Florida, with the rest scattered through the South, Midwest and West. No deaths have occurred in the Northeast so far, \"likely due to the cool, damp pattern we've seen in New England,\" Jensensius said. \"There have been less severe thunderstorms there.\"\n\n\n\nSummer is the deadliest season for lightning strikes because of the frequency of thunderstorms and the fact that more people are outdoors. This week, the first official week of summer, marks \"Lightning Safety Awareness Week\" for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\n\n\nThe agency's message is \"When Thunder Roars, Go Indoors.\" That's because all the people killed by lightning in the U.S. so far this year -- and the 28 killed in 2008 -- were outdoors. Taking shelter under trees offers little safety -- nearly one-third of the people killed by lightning last year were under a tree when they were hit.\n\n\n\nMore than 400 people in the U.S. are hit by lightning each year, according to the National Weather Service. Lightning, on average, kills more people than hurricanes and tornadoes combined (among all weather-related fatalities, only floods kill more). While not all injuries result in death, many victims are left with devastating and permanent disabilities.\n\n\n\nYou may remember that as a child you were told to count the seconds between a lightning flash and thunder to see how far away the lightning was. But by the time you calculate it, it may be too late. Sometimes thunder and lightning can happen simultaneously.\n\n\n\nDespite its \"Sunshine State\" nickname, Florida receives more cloud-to-ground lightning than any other state in the country, according to data from NASA satellites.\n\n\n\nBut Florida does not receive the most lightning in the world.

Now scientists worry that someday, they'll try to take over your brain.\n\n\n\nScientists can use brain signals to control computers -- hands free.\n\n\n\nIn the past year, researchers have developed technology that makes it possible to use thoughts to operate a computer, maneuver a wheelchair or even use Twitter -- all without lifting a finger. But as neural devices become more complicated, and go wireless, some scientists say the risks of \"brain hacking\" should be taken seriously.\n\n\n\n\"Neural devices are innovating at an extremely rapid rate and hold tremendous promise for the future,\" said computer security expert Tadayoshi Kohno of the University of Washington.\n\n\n\n\"But if we don't start paying attention to security, we're worried that we might find ourselves in five or 10 years saying we've made a big mistake.\"\n\n\n\nHackers tap into personal computers all the time. But what would happen if they focused their nefarious energy on neural devices, such as the deep-brain stimulators used to treat Parkinson's and depression, or electrode systems for controlling prosthetic limbs?\n\n\n\nAccording to Kohno and his colleagues, who published their concerns July 1 in Neurosurgical Focus, most devices carry few security risks. But as neural engineering becomes more complex and more widespread, the potential for security breaches will mushroom.\n\n\n\n\"It's very hard to design complex systems that don't have bugs,\" Kohno said. \"As these medical devices start to become more and more complicated, it gets easier and easier for people to overlook a bug that could become a very serious risk. It might border on science fiction today, but so did going to the moon 50 years ago.\"\n\n\n\nSome might question why anyone would want to hack into someone else's brain, but the researchers say there's a precedent for using computers to cause neurological harm. In November 2007 and March 2008, malicious programmers vandalized epilepsy support Web sites by putting up flashing animations, which caused seizures in some photo-sensitive patients.\n\n\n\n\"It happened on two separate occasions,\" said computer science graduate student Tamara Denning, a co-author on the paper. \"It's evidence that people will be malicious and try to compromise peoples' health using computers, especially if neural devices become more widespread.\"\n\n\n\nIn some cases, patients might even want to hack into their own neural device. Unlike devices to control prosthetic limbs, which still use wires, many deep brain stimulators already rely on wireless signals. Hacking into these devices could enable patients to \"self-prescribe\" elevated moods or pain relief by increasing the activity of the brain's reward centers.\n\n\n\nDespite the risks, Kohno said, most new devices aren't created with security in mind. Neural engineers carefully consider the safety and reliability of new equipment, and neuroethicists focus on whether a new device fits ethical guidelines. But until now, few groups have considered how neural devices might be hijacked to perform unintended actions. This is the first time an academic paper has addressed the topic of \"neurosecurity,\" a term the group coined to describe their field.\n\n\n\n\"The security and privacy issues somehow seem to slip by,\" Kohno said. \"I would not be surprised if most people working in this space have never thought about security.\"\n\n\n\nKevin Otto, a bioengineer who studies brain-machine interfaces at Purdue Universty, said he was initially skeptical of the research. \"When I first picked up the paper, I don't know if I agreed that it was an issue. But the paper gives a very compelling argument that this is important, and that this is the time to have neural engineers collaborate with security developers.\"\n\n\n\nIt's never too early to start thinking about security issues, said neural engineer Justin Williams of the University of Wisconsin, who was not involved in the research. But he stressed that the kinds of devices available today are not susceptible to attack, and that fear of future risks shouldn't impede progress in the field. \"These kinds of security issues have to proceed in lockstep with the technology,\" Williams said", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- It's amazing how a huge global phenomenon", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- It's amazing how a huge global phenomenon can begin.\n\n\n\nTetris, the simple puzzle video game, has been addicting players for 25 years.\n\n\n\nIn 1984, Russian mathematician Alexey Pajitnov was playing with one of his favorite puzzles when he had an inspiration: How about creating a computer version?\n\n\n\nPajitnov wrote the program in his spare time, simplifying the idea to make it easier for those of us who aren't math geniuses.\n\n\n\nHe used shapes made of four squares -- hence \"Tetris,\" which comes from the Greek word for four, \"Tetra.\"\n\n\n\nIn the game, players must position and stack blocky shapes to fill a grid without leaving spaces in between.

It is the first day of June and our last week before summer break. Thank you very much for joining us.\n\n\n\nFirst Up: A Look Back\n\n\n\nAZUZ: First up, a major move for the country's largest automaker as General Motors is expected to file for bankruptcy today. This comes one month after Chrysler, another of the so-called \"Big Three\" U.S. car companies, did the very same thing. Under the terms of General Motors' bankruptcy, the company will be reorganized and essentially taken over by the government. Thirty years ago, GM made up more than 40 percent of U.S. auto sales. Today, that number is 19 percent. The company's reported more than $90 billion in losses since 2005. As the bankruptcy process begins, Christine Romans looks back at the history of GM and the American car.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Henry Ford started at the beginning of the last century with four wheels and a running board; 1908 was the birth of American car culture. That same year, General Motors was formed in Flint, Michigan. It wasn't until 1925 when the \"Big Three\" was complete with the formation of Chrysler Corporation.\n\n\n\nJOHN DAVIS, HOST, MOTORWEEK: When the Big Three emerged, they not only emerged as rivals that really gave Americans much better automobiles at the time, but they also cemented the American automobile as a world standard.\n\n\n\nROMANS: \"As goes General Motors, so goes the nation.\" That phrase defined America's economic power for much of the last century.\n\n\n\nPETER MORICI, ECONOMIST, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND: So many folks were either employed at General Motors or the other two major car makers, making steel and all the other components that go into cars. It just meant that if the automobile companies were prospering, the country was prospering, too.\n\n\n\nROMANS: Today, there are 74,000 rank-and-file GM workers in the U.S. But in its heyday, GM was the largest industrial company in the world; a technology leader. By 1979, 600,000 people worked for GM. Those good jobs helped build America's middle class.\n\n\n\nDAVIS: It also allowed us to migrate out from the cities to have the quarter lot in a suburb, to basically get away from a lot of the congestion of the metropolitan areas.\n\n\n\nROMANS: General Moters was the company that revolutionized what we drove, how we thought about our cars, and how we paid for them. GM invented auto loans and the model year. It was the first to hire designers instead of engineers to create new car concepts; think big fins and chrome of the 1950s and 60s. And everything changed. Ford adopted flashy fins with the Ford Fairlane, as did Chrysler with the popular Desoto. Automobiles from the Big Three put their stamp on popular culture, from music to movies to television. What's considered to be the first rock and roll song ever recorded was \"Rocket 88\" by Ike Turner, about a GM product. The Pontiac GTO, considered by many to be the first true muscle car, was showcased in a song by Ronnie and the Daytonas.\n\n\n\nRONNIE AND THE DAYTONAS, \"LITTLE GTO\": Little GTO, you really....\n\n\n\nROMANS: The Corvette on Route 66.

Two crosses with helmets placed atop them -- the sign of a fallen soldier -- are visible. Two Germans are knee deep in mud. Another, with a handlebar mustache, has the look of a defeated man. The bodies of 22 American soldiers were found in at least seven graves, according to the photographer.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the back of the photo is written, \"Nazi Party members digging up American bodies at Berga.\"   Berga an der Elster was a slave labor camp where 350 U.S. soldiers were beaten, starved, and forced to work in tunnels for the German government. The soldiers were singled out for \"looking like Jews\" or \"sounding like Jews,\" or dubbed as undesirables, according to survivors. More than 100 soldiers perished at the camp or on a forced death march.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was on this day six decades ago, April 23, 1945, when most of the slave labor camp soldiers were liberated by advancing U.S. troops. The emaciated soldiers, many weighing just 80 pounds, had been forced by Nazi commanders to march more than 150 miles before their rescue.  Watch survivor break down in tears over liberation \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new photograph was likely taken in May or June 1945 when U.S. war crimes investigators combed Berga. It was donated earlier this month to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum by Jim Martin and his family, whose father, Elmore \"Bud\" Martin, is believed to have snapped the picture as part of the war crimes investigation team.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe photo and dozens of others sat for years in Jim Martin's closet. Some of the photos, including graphic images of American corpses, were placed on record at the National Archives years ago.

We didn't realize what it was.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nElmore Martin, who won a Silver Star for his valor in capturing images during the war, was 28 when he shot the photographs. Before the war, he worked as a photographer for the St. Paul Dispatch and Pioneer Press. Martin's son said his dad, who died several years ago, struggled to keep a job when he returned home. \"I now see where it all started,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Elmore Martin and the war crimes soldiers seen in the photo couldn't have known that day was how the case would evolve.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two Berga commanders -- Erwin Metz and his superior, Hauptmann Ludwig Merz -- were tried for war crimes and initially sentenced to die by hanging. But the U.S. government commuted their death sentences in 1948, and both men were eventually released in the 1950s. One other Berga commander, Lt. Willy Hack, was executed, but not by the United States. He died by hanging, justice carried out by the Soviets.\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Martin said his father would have been upset at the freeing of the Berga commanders after the atrocities he documented. \"He knew it happened and to see that these people were released would be pretty devastating.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEfraim Zuroff, who has spent nearly 30 years hunting Nazis responsible for the Holocaust, said the U.S. government commuted the sentences and freed hundreds of war criminals like those at Berga after the war, as the Cold War began to intensify.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They were more concerned about keeping out Communists than admitting victims of the Nazis", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "NORFOLK, Virginia (CNN) -- Negotiators aboard a U.", "paragraphs": [{"context": "NORFOLK, Virginia (CNN) -- Negotiators aboard a U.S. Navy warship are trying to secure the release of an American freighter captain who is being held by pirates on a lifeboat off the coast of Somalia, according to Maersk Line Ltd.\n\nCapt.

It was built in the 1940s as part of the \"Manhattan Project\" to develop the first atomic weapon during World War II.\n\n\n\n\n\nMillions of dollars and thousands of jobs poured into the remote area about 75 miles east of Yakima where nine nuclear reactors were eventually built.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the Cold War, Hanford was a buzzing hive of activity, eventually becoming the main source of plutonium production for the nation's nuclear weapons program.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecades of improper radioactive waste disposal earned Hanford the notorious distinction of being most contaminated nuclear site in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the Hanford site is a virtual ghost town and those involved in the clean-up project say they will need every dollar of the federal stimulus funds.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are still millions of gallons of untreated contaminated groundwater, hundreds of buildings used for plutonium enrichment that need to be torn down, and underground tanks that are full of radioactive sludge.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stimulus money will reduce the clean-up time by years, according to Jon Peschong, who oversees the federal project at Hanford.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was perfect work, ready to go for the stimulus package,\" Peschong said. \"Each day that passes the conditions worsen [and] the receipt of the federal stimulus money allows us to reduce the costs and also allows us to reduce the clean up footprint much sooner, years sooner.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe money is also created jobs for about 1,400 people at Hanford, including Joe Gill who manages a team that is tearing down equipment that is heavily contaminated by radiation. Despite the dangers of his job, Gill said it came just at the right time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had managed a production warehouse facility for one of the largest companies in the world, [I] thought I'd be there for 20 years,\" Gill said. \"We laid off 8,000 people in three months and they closed down our plant, [and] those jobs aren't jobs you just read the paper and get.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is clear by watching Gill's team perform their time-consuming daily tasks that Hanford won't be decontanimated quickly. The workers have to suit up three to four times a day in protective gear. They break down contaminated equipment through a \"glove box,\" allowing them to disassemble the equipment a room away through lead-lined gloves. Each time a worker removes their hands from the gloves, they must be wanded down by a colleague checking for any radiation exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe large scale of the project and years of cost overruns have led critics to complain that stimulus money is being misdirected at Hanford.

Jonathan Breeze, the CEO of Jet Republic, tells CNN how he's working to create a carbon neutral airline.\n\n\n\nLONDON, England -- The aviation industry is often perceived as one of the bad guys in the climate change debate. As a mode of transport, flying is regarded as being particularly polluting because of the amount of fuel used at high altitude. And, it is estimated to be responsible for around 3.5 percent of global greenhouse emissions.\n\n\n\nJet Republic CEO Jonathan Breeze says it would be a mistake to let green initiatives in the airline industry fall by the wayside.\n\n\n\nThe sector's reputation was damaged further when it was excluded from the targets outlined in the Kyoto agreement, which was interpreted by some as an example of its disregard for the climate change issue.\n\n\n\nThis is unfair because the industry has taken great strides to reduce its environmental impact. For example, over the last 30 years, it has achieved a 60 percent improvement in fuel efficiency.\n\n\n\nThere is a great deal of research being undertaken by manufacturers into more efficient technologies and alternative fuels, while the Single European Sky initiative aims to improve flight planning across Europe to rationalize the amount of time an aircraft is in the sky.\n\n\n\nPractically everything we do in our everyday lives has a carbon cost attached to it, but aviation is an element that we believe has come in for an undue level of criticism, when in fact it is arguably working harder than most industries to address the issue of climate change.\n\n\n\nThe reaction to this criticism from governments has been taxation. But making a special case of aviation fails to address the wider issues.\n\n\n\nAviation fuel is carbon taxed, but why is this tax not applied on other types of fuel such as electricity and gas? The additional revenue that would be generated could be ploughed back into green energy schemes and help deliver heightened efficiencies that our industry is already investigating.\n\n\n\nPunitive taxation, which is driving up the cost of air travel, will ultimately end up being absorbed by the operator or by passengers. This, coupled with the current economic downturn, represents a significant threat to progress in the aviation industry as it could lead to a stifling of innovation and development.\n\n\n\nMeeting the challenge of climate change costs money -- modernizing fleets with more efficient aircraft comes at a price. As an industry which has been hit hard by the downturn, some of these initiatives could fall by the wayside. To allow this to happen would be a grave mistake.\n\n\n\nWe identified climate change as one area where we wanted to set the standard in the industry, and as a new entrant to the market we have been able to build a commitment to carbon neutrality into the heart of our business operations. It was a consideration in our choice of the Learjet 60 XR as the model of aircraft in our 110 strong fleet.\n\n\n\nThe 60 XR is the most fuel-efficient midsize aircraft in the world, something it achieves by being built with light and strong modern materials, and flying higher and faster than other aircraft. It's a perfect example of a win-win solution. We burn less fuel; our customers enjoy lower pricing.\n\n\n\nAircraft positioning is another important consideration that has an impact on the amount of fuel consumed; our fleet is based all across Europe, to reflect where our clients are. The positions of our aircraft are carefully planned and managed so that the number of \"over flights\" -- that is legs where the aircraft is empty -- are kept to an absolute minimum.\n\n\n\nWe wanted to be 100 percent carbon neutral from launch so we partnered with ClimateCare, one of Europe's most experienced providers of carbon offsets, where each project is rigorously audited and monitored for quality. By comparison, under the European emissions trading scheme, which doesn't take effect until 2012, commercial airlines will only have to offset 15 percent of the carbon emissions they create.\n\n\n\nWith the impact of aviation on climate change being widely reported, people are more conscious than ever about ", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "(CNN)  -- Former Italian international star Filipp", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN)  -- Former Italian international star Filippo Inzaghi scored a hat-trick as AC Milan went second in Serie A with a 5-1 win over Torino in the San Siro on Sunday.\n\n\n\nBeckham and Mathieu Flamini take part in an unusual goal celebration in the San Siro.\n\n\n\nThe legendary goalscorer has now put away nine in the last six matches but it was his combination with England international David Beckham which electrified the Milan fans.\n\n\n\nBeckham, who had sat out the last two games because of a shoulder injury, set up Inzaghi for his opening two goals in the 13th and 37th minutes from a corner and a clever chip, both headed home.\n\n\n\nAfter the interval, Inzaghi completed his hat-trick on the hour mark before Kaka added a penalty for the fourth.\n\n\n\nIvan Franceschini pulled one back for Torino in the 80th minute, but Massimo Ambrosini rounded off the Milan scoring in the final minute.\n\n\n\nThe win sees Milan level on points with Juventus but with a better goal difference.

It was an old bike with a broken belt and I had to fix it. Today, people who don't even know me gave me the greatest gift that a president could have: to host the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Rio deserves this because Rio is a city that has suffered.\"\n\n\n\nFor Lula da Silva, Friday's announcement in Copenhagen, Denmark, that Rio de Janeiro will host the 31st Olympiad in 2016 signified a major achievement not only for his hemisphere (no city in South America has ever before hosted the games) but for him -- a former autoworker and union organizer who defied dizzying odds to become president.\n\n\n\nLula da Silva was born to a peasant family in one of northeastern Brazil's most impoverished areas and migrated as a young man to a city near S\u00e3o Paulo, where he worked as a metalworker, losing his left pinky finger in the process.\n\n\n\nIn the 1970s, he became a union leader, said Luiz Valente, chairman of the department of Portuguese and Brazilian studies at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\n\n\nDuring the years of military rule from 1964 until 1985, the government cracked down on unions. But Lula da Silva acquired a reputation as a public figure by leading a successful strike in S\u00e3o Paulo, Valente told CNN in a telephone interview.\n\n\n\n\"He was able to negotiate a favorable contract for his union but, from a political standpoint, he demonstrated that worker strikes were possible again in Brazil,\" Valente said.\n\n\n\nDuring the early 1980s, as the military rulers' grip on control loosened, Lula da Silva helped found the leftist Workers' Party.\n\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, he ran for Congress and won, but he chose not to run for re-election. Instead, he set his sights on the top job, waging a losing presidential campaign in 1989, the country's first presidential election since 1960. Successive tries in 1993 and 1997 were unsuccessful, but in 2001, he won and quickly surprised many observers.\n\n\n\n\"When he began, he was perceived as someone very much on the left,\" said Valente. \"He was perceived as being a socialist. However, he has not governed as a socialist. Instead, his economic policies were a continuation of the previous administration's.\"\n\n\n\nIn fact, Brazil's economic policy has been \"pretty much middle of the road, some people would say pretty conservative,\" said Valente, who added that he has never voted for Lula da Silva.\n\n\n\nBut Lula da Silva has worked to help the country's poor, introducing populist measures intended to lower the incidence of poverty and making other moves, Valente said.\n\n\n\n\"As a union leader during the military dictatorship, he learned how to negotiate with the so-called enemy,\" Valente said. \"So Lula is going to try to reach some kind of consensus, and he did. What he did was not a product of ideology but of a pragmatist attitude of the government of Brazil.\"\n\n\n\nLula da Silva's moderate modus operandi has gained him popularity at home, where he has made no moves toward abolishing the term limits that preclude his running for a third term next year, Valente said.\n\n\n\nThat pragmatism has served him well on the international front, where he is on good terms with the leftist governments of Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador as well as with the United States and the European Union. \"Lula knows how to play the game,\" Valente said", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- Elizabeth Taylor is having a \"procedure o", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Elizabeth Taylor is having a \"procedure on her heart,\" she announced on her Twitter page Tuesday.\n\n\n\nElizabeth Taylor has used Twitter to share personal information.\n\n\n\n\"It's very new and involves repairing my leaky valve using a clip device, without open heart surgery, so that my heart will function better,\" the famed actress wrote. \"Any prayers you happen to have lying around I would dearly appreciate.

She is chairwoman of the Harvard Institute of Politics Policy Group on Racial Profiling.\n\nNafees Syed says President Obama's early words and actions send a powerful, positive signal to Muslims.\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (CNN) -- President Obama has given the Muslim community around the world the message we have been waiting for.\n\nHe reassured Muslims in America that \"We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus -- and nonbelievers.\" For those like me who were critical of his standoffish attitude toward Islam during his campaign, this signaled a welcome change.\n\nEven more important was his subsequent statement: \"To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect.\"\n\nIn traveling throughout Western Europe in the past two years, I heard several anti-American comments; these Europeans were challenging me, a Muslim, about American foreign policy in Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nIn Muslim countries, I've heard admiring comments about how great it must be to live in a rich country like America, followed by accusations that, \"your President Bush doesn't like us Muslims.\"\n\nAs a Muslim-American, I have found myself in a difficult position. In America, I've had to explain Islam to other Americans, and abroad, I've had to explain America to those in the Muslim world.\n\nObama has done all Americans a favor by extending a hand of friendship to the Muslim world. For me personally, it has alleviated the pain of witnessing the country I love engage in a foreign policy that I could not approve of as a Muslim and as an American -- a foreign policy that created mutual distrust between Americans and Muslims. And Obama has followed up on his statements with actions.\n\nIn his first steps as president, Obama has initiated the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison, called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Iraq and appointed former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, well-respected for his role in the Northern Ireland peace process, as special envoy for the Middle East.\n\nFor the past few weeks, I've heard overwhelming praise from Muslims for Obama's recent actions.\n\nObama has recognized a key fact that former President George W. Bush did not: Muslims in America and elsewhere are strongly affected by the situation of other Muslims in the world.\n\nThere is a popular saying of the Prophet Mohammed's that the Muslim community is like one body: If one part hurts, the entire body feels the pain. Muslims are very aware of this message and, in the last 20 years, three conflicts have continuously dominated the Muslim consciousness: Chechnya, Kashmir and, most notably, Palestine.\n\nObama recognized this when he chose his first interview as president to be with a reporter from Al-Arabiya, indicating he would actively engage Arab media. The Palestinian-Israeli issue dominated the interview, with Obama promising to work toward a solution involving both sides of the conflict.\n\nTo understand the challenge Obama faces in changing America's role in the conflict, one must realize the situation he walked into as president. Muslims around the world were watching the suffering of innocent Palestinian civilians in a Gaza military campaign conducted with a green light from the Bush administration. Obama is essentially trying to rebuild a relationship that has been destroyed.\n\nHowever, Obama's tone of respect and not condescension, a clear break with the past, improves the chances that such a relationship could arise.\n\nHis interview with Al-Arabiya was filled with reassuring statements that America is \"ready to initiate a new partnership based on mutual respect and mutual interest,\" that \"the language we use has to be a language of respect.\" After years of hearing rhetoric of \"a crusade\" and \"Islamofascism\" from the U.S. government, Obama's policy of listening, not dictating, has generated optimism in the Muslim world.\n\nI ", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- Judge Sonia Sotomayor knew she wanted to ", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Judge Sonia Sotomayor knew she wanted to go into law from an early age.\n\n\n\nSonia Sotomayor says the nomination is the \"most humbling honor \" of her life.\n\n\n\nAs a child, she aspired to be like Nancy Drew, the detective in the popular children's mystery series.

The Corps of Engineers, on its Web site, says a miter gate \"has two leaves that provide a closure at one end of the lock.\" They are so named because the two leaves meet at an angle pointing upstream and resembling a miter joint, the Web site said, referring to a joint meeting at a 45-degree angle, such as the corner of a picture frame.\n\n\n\nA public policy organization, in a February 2008 report, graded the locks' performance as a D, \"based primarily upon risk of failure due to unreliability of miter gates.\"\n\n\n\nThe federal government allocated $10.6 million to install new chamber miter gates, according to Waterways Council Inc., which describes itself as an organization \"advocating a modern and well-maintained national system of ports and inland waterways.\"\n\n\n\nHornback said the work was scheduled for 2011, adding that it's unclear whether Sunday's break will speed that up.\n\n\n\n\"The risk is very high that a failure of the lock gates will occur, forcing traffic through the auxiliary lock for an extended period, causing huge delays and costs to the towing industry,\" the council said in the report last year.\n\n\n\nEngineers hope to have the river back open as soon as possible, Hornback said, but an exact time frame was not known.\n\n\n\nSome 55 million tons of commodities pass through the Markland Locks each year, according to the Waterways Council.

Chris Christie surfaced once again in the national news this week, floated by some as a possible new entrant in the ever-widening, fickle field of Republican presidential contenders.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Christie got even more attention on his own by heading straight to the \"Jersey Shore\" -- the TV show.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Christie vetoed a $420,000 tax break previously granted to MTV's most popular program -- the highly viewed and just as highly derided reality series featuring Snooki, The Situation and other often inebriated free-range narcissists. In denying the show's producers the New Jersey Economic Development Authority's 20% tax credit on TV shows filmed or produced in the state, Christie said it was unjustifiable \"for a project which does nothing more than perpetuate misconceptions about the state and its citizens.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLike a rain-slicked Atlantic City boardwalk as it snakes its way to the shore, that's some slippery ground on which Christie is treading.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's difficult, maybe even impossible, to disagree with him on the position of being anti-\"Jersey Shore\": Anything that slows the spread of that video virus is, almost by definition, a good thing. But what if the same logic and political tactics had been used on, say, HBO's \"The Sopranos\"? Even if that sort of concern amounts to fiscal responsibility, it also amounts to artistic irresponsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoliticians have attacked TV before, but the attention they draw rarely has them getting the last word, or being awarded the final victory. Dan Quayle vs. \"Murphy Brown\"? The CBS sitcom won that one, handily; the single mother about whom Quayle was so upset was, after all, a fictional TV character.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush, in 1992, campaigned by promising to make American families \"a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons.\" Bart, one of the animated characters on \"The Simpsons,\" retaliated almost instantly in a quickly dubbed opening credits sequence, replying, \"We're just like the Waltons. We're praying for an end to the Depression, too.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChristie, by pulling the state purse strings tighter and refusing to hand over rebate tax credit money to TV productions that make New Jersey look bad, is wielding a heavy club. Where else, after all, could \"Jersey Shore\" film its reality-show escapades? Italy? (Actually, yes. They've done just that. But MTV and \"Jersey Shore\" haven't yet gone to the original Jersey shore, nestled in the English Channel and part of the United Kingdom. Maybe next year.)\n\n\n\n\n\nOr maybe, if CW's \"H8R\" lasts another season (which is doubtful), Christie could come on as a Snooki \"hater,\" as a nonfan did to confront the \"Jersey Shore\" standout star in this month's season premiere, and take away her show's tax credits on camera.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut really, the biggest media storm he could generate here, and the one that would score him even stronger political points, would be to make the tax credits, or the denial of them, qualitative as well as quantitative, and thus support the arts in the most measurable way possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nBear with me here: Christie could make it a policy to give tax rebates for the quality shows, and levy fines -- tackiness taxes, if you will -- for those that besmirch New Jersey in particular and the lively arts in general.\n\n\n\n\n\nMake good TV and movies, you get money back. Make bad TV and movies, you pay a surcharge.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder such a system, the better the TV show or movie, the higher the tax incentives.

It spurred two sequels, theme park attractions and an extensive line of merchandise.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was followed by films like \"A Bug's Life,\" \"Monster's Inc.,\" \"Finding Nemo,\" and \"The Incredibles,\" the last two of which won Academy Awards for best animated feature.

Albright served as secretary of state under President Bill Clinton.\n\n\n\n(CNN) -- In this age of electronic media communications, Americans are increasingly confronted in their living rooms -- and even on their cell phones -- with information about and images of genocide and mass atrocities virtually anywhere they occur.\n\n\n\nThis instantaneous media communication has sensitized many Americans to the suffering of people in all corners of the globe. The Internet has proved to be a powerful tool for organizing broad-based responses to genocide and mass atrocities, as we have seen in response to the crisis in Darfur.\n\n\n\nWith all of this information written and broadcast about the horrors of genocide and mass atrocities around the world, why do they continue? And as public citizens, public officials and policymakers, how can we prevent this horrendous crime that assaults our humanitarian values and threatens our national security?\n\n\n\nLast year, we agreed to co-chair the Genocide Prevention Task Force, which was jointly convened by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, The American Academy of Diplomacy and the United States Institute of Peace. (The final report is to be released next week.)\n\n\n\nThe idea for the task force arose out of a desire by each of these institutions to reach beyond their individual capabilities and build a practical framework that could help the U.S. government better respond to threats of genocide and mass atrocities. Our challenge was to match words to deeds and stop allowing the unacceptable. That task is in fact one of the most persistent puzzles of our times.\n\n\n\nMany people ask: Why do genocides and mass atrocities happen?\n\n\n\nThere is no consensus as to the causes of genocide and mass atrocities, nor is there one commonly agreed-upon theory that explains the key catalysts, motivations or mechanisms that lead to them. History has shown that genocide and mass atrocities manifest themselves in highly variable ways, and we should not assume that future perpetrators will follow old patterns.\n\n\n\nHowever, there are warning signs. Genocide is not the inevitable result of \"ancient hatreds\" or irrational leaders. It requires planning and is carried out systematically. But that fact also means that there are ways to recognize its signs and symptoms, and viable options to prevent it at every turn, if we are committed and prepared.\n\n\n\nOur report recommends a number of distinct but interrelated areas where the United States government can develop and deploy more effective strategies to identify and pursue opportunities for prevention of genocide and mass atrocities:\n\n\n\nFirst, we believe that leadership is an indispensable ingredient. Nothing is more central to preventing genocide than leadership -- from the president, Congress and the American people. Making progress requires leaders to summon political will not only after a crisis strikes, but also before one emerges.\n\n\n\nSecond is the importance of early warning. It is critical for policymakers to have good analysis of areas where there is a high risk of genocide or organized violence in order to design effective strategies and spur action. By improving the accuracy of warnings, we will find greater opportunities for preventive action.\n\n\n\nEarly prevention can avert a crisis. Many countries are vulnerable to extreme violence. By engaging leaders, institutions and civil society at an early stage, the United States can help countries steer clear of these dangers.\n\n\n\nPreventive diplomacy is critical to halt and reverse escalation. Even when signs of preparation for genocide are apparent, there are opportunities to alter leaders' decisions and interrupt their plans. By improving our crisis response system, we will be better prepared to mount coherent, carefully calibrated and timely preventive diplomatic strategies.\n\n\n\nA willingness to utilize military options to stop ongoing atrocities when prevention efforts have failed is crucial. U.S. military assets can also play an important role in supporting and providing credibility to options short of the use of force, including by deterring violence through military presence or threat.\n\n\n\nLastly, we cite the power of international action.

Sounds predictable, right? But weather in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, or ITCZ, can be volatile and dangerous.\n\n\n\nAir France Flight 447 went down in a volatile zone along the equator between South America and Africa.\n\n\n\nThe Intertropical Convergence Zone, which circles the Earth near the equator, is where officials say Air France Flight 447 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean. While weather has not been cited as a reason for the plane's crash, the tragedy does call attention to the region.\n\n\n\nThe ITCZ is a belt of low pressure that wraps around the planet. Clouds and storms form along it because it is literally where the winds of the world's hemispheres meet.\n\n\n\nHigh pressure in the Northern Hemisphere churns air from the northeast toward the equator. On the flip side, air is steered from the southeast by high pressure in the Southern Hemisphere. The winds that move this air toward the equator are also known as \"trade winds\" and converge in the middle of the tropics. That's where the Intertropical Convergence Zone name comes from.\n\n\n\nHere, air and water temperatures are typically in the mid-80s. The warm, moist air is heated further by the blazing tropical sun. Steamy air, coming off the ocean, rises until it hits cooler, drier air aloft, forming clouds and thunderstorms. These gigantic storms contain volatile updrafts and downdrafts that can move at speeds of 100 mph.\n\n\n\nThe height of these storms also can tower to more than 10 miles in the air. Even if you stacked two dozen of the world's tallest skyscrapers on top of each other, they still wouldn't reach the tops of the biggest thunderstorms of the ITCZ.\n\n\n\nFormer Air Force meteorologist Tim Vasquez wrote about thunderstorms over the Atlantic at the time of the Air France plane's disappearance on his Web site, weathergraphics.com.\n\n\n\n\"Based on the infrared satellite imagery, I was able to. . .estimate the altitude of the thunderstorms at around 51,000 feet,\" he told CNN in a phone interview.\n\n\n\nVasquez himself has flown through the ITCZ at least half a dozen times.\n\n\n\n\"I remember flying from Guam to the Philippines, constantly weaving around the thunderstorms. Sometimes, though, pilots are forced to fly through them,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThat's because commercial airliners cannot fly above 50,000 feet. In addition, ITCZ thunderstorms can merge with one another to stretch far and wide, covering hundreds of miles.\n\n\n\nThe crew of Air France Flight 447 reported severe turbulence shortly before the plane disappeared.  How did the plane break into pieces? \u00bb\n\n\n\nWhen it's not storming in the ITCZ, the weather can be completely calm, with little to no wind. This stretch of ocean was particularly dreaded by sailors of the 19th century, who named it \"The Doldrums,\" because its lack of wind could leave them stuck at sea, unable to propel forward.\n\n\n\nDespite these challenges and dangers, planes and ships successfully cross the ITZC every day, thanks in part to technology that has made it easier to see where the thunderstorms are.\n\n\n\nHere are some commonly asked questions:\n\n\n\nCan hurricanes form in the ITCZ?\n\n\n\nIt's extremely rare for a hurricane to form near the equator. However, the ITCZ doesn't stay in one place all year long. In the summer, for example, it drifts more northward, where it's possible for tropical cyclones to develop from the thunderstorms there.\n\n\n\nWhat does the ITCZ have to do with the \"monsoon season\" in Asia?\n\n\n\nSince the position of the ITCZ fluctuates, the location of the heaviest rainfalls varies depending on the time of year. When the zone drifts more northward in May and June, it brings the rainy season to places like Southeast Asia and India. The term \"monsoon\" refers to a seasonal reversal of winds.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Editor's note: With fears of a swine flu pandemic ", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Editor's note: With fears of a swine flu pandemic rising daily, CNN Pentagon producer Larry Shaughnessy remembered a batch of letters from his grandfather, a World War I soldier who battled the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1919.\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin \"Al\" Culhane, left, is pictured with his older brother, Frank, around 1918 or 1919.\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON (CNN)  -- \"I'm coming, I'm coming For my head is bending low I hear those gentle voices calling Old Black Joe\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs World War I rages in Europe, fresh U.S. Army soldiers pass the time on a train ride to to Camp Forrest, Georgia. \"The boys are just starting to sing,\" Martin Aloysius Culhane wrote on September 6, 1918, to his friend back home. \"They've gotten back to 'Old Black Joe' so far.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStephen Foster's classic song from the Civil War is about the death of slaves who had become his friends.

We will be waiting for you here.\"\n\n\n\nThe officers arrested Saturday are on the police force in the city of Arteaga.\n\n\n\nMexican President Felipe Calderon, whose home state is Michoacan, responded to the violence by dispatching 1,000 federal police officers to the area. The infusion, which more than tripled the number of federal police officers patrolling Michoacan, angered Michoacan Gov. Leonel Godoy Rangel. He called it an occupation and said he had not been consulted.\n\n\n\nAuthorities said Wednesday they were searching for the governor's half-brother, who they say is a top-ranking member of La Familia Michoacana drug cartel. The cartel is blamed for most of the recent violence in the state. The governor's brother, Julio Cesar Godoy Toscano, was elected July 5 to the lower house of Congress.\n\n\n\nThe governor has publicly urged his brother to surrender. There were no reports of his apprehension as of late Saturday.\n\n\n\nThe sudden spike in violence followed the arrest July 11 of Arnoldo Rueda Medina, described as a high-ranking member of La Familia.\n\n\n\nLa Familia members attacked the federal police station in Morelia to try to gain freedom for Rueda shortly after his arrest, authorities said. When that failed, cartel members attacked federal police installations in at least a half-dozen Michoacan cities.\n\n\n\nUnder Mexican law, the officers arrested Saturday will be held for 40 days while officials determine whether to formally charge them.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "London, England -- Petra Nemcova is a former Victo", "paragraphs": [{"context": "London, England -- Petra Nemcova is a former Victoria's Secret supermodel-turned-philanthropist.\n\n\n\nDespite her riches, Nemcova, who grew up with few luxuries in communist Czechoslovakia, told CNN that her most important work is her charity, the Happy Hearts Fund.\n\n\n\nThe model set up the foundation after her near-death experience in the 2004 Asian tsunami.

I would wake up at 5.45 in the morning, take the bus for one hour, then a tram to school. After school I would take a five-hour train to Prague. So it was quite intense at that time, but it was a great experience and it taught me a lot about being independent.\n\n\n\nCNN: How would you describe Prague, in five words?\n\n\n\nPetra Nemcova: Prague is a city of romance, of incredible architecture and history. Some people call it the \"golden city,\" some people say it's the heart of Europe -- although maybe the French don't like that very much! Paris is bigger obviously and a bit more hectic and Prague is smaller and has more of a village-y feeling compared to Paris. Prague has more of a calming vibe. It's not rush-rush-rush.\n\n\n\nI think when people come here they are surprised by the beauty of Prague and also the vivid colors. I think they may imagine Prague more in gray colors because of the communist association. But since then a lot of reconstruction has been done. Before Prague was shades of grey and black, which was quite mysterious, but now it's more happy and pretty.\n\n\n\nIn five words it's historical, inspirational, creative, romantic and beautiful.\n\n\n\nCNN: What was your childhood like?\n\n\n\nPetra Nemcova: Growing up in the Czech Republic -- at the time Czechoslovakia -- was a beautiful childhood because I didn't understand the whole concept of communism. I was only 11 when communism fell down and when the Velvet Revolution happened. I had a really beautiful childhood ... I didn't have the great luxury things, we had very little and we counted every penny. But our parents gave us something more valuable than money -- they gave us so much love and that's priceless.\n\n\n\nWe didn't get the opportunity to travel all over the world and were able to travel only within the communist countries. So we went around our country to see different castles, little towns and I loved it. So that made us richer. It also made us appreciate nature because we spent every weekend in nature. And the values you learn there are priceless too. You don't step on flowers, kick on mushrooms, you really respect nature.\n\n\n\nAnd the value of appreciation came from not having anything and then having a little bit. Having a clementine for Christmas -- it was an incredible joy and every time I smell a clementine, it brings me back to my childhood.\n\n\n\nBut it was harder for my parents.

Her attorney, Gloria Allred, employs her studied grimace as Sharon Bialek tells of an encounter 14 years ago that, if true, constitutes an unreported sexual assault. At his own press conference the next day, candidate Cain issues a heated denial, having earlier hinted at a willingness to take a lie detector test.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow would the court system, America's formal arbiter of truth, evaluate the competing claims?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe courts would refuse to even consider them. In the legal world, courts scrupulously enforce statutes of limitations on accusations of improper or criminal conduct. The rules exist because it is unfair to force the accused to defend against a charge of ancient vintage. Witness memories and evidence have grown stale and the courts believe that evidence is best evaluated and most reliable when it is fresh.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rare exceptions to this rule almost always involve the abuse of children and particularly heinous crimes like murder. The law provides no sanctuary for women who seek to resurrect sexual harassment claims from as distant as 14 years in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Herman Cain now exists in the realm of politics and not the courtroom. Cain must find a way to prove his innocence to a skeptical public regarding a suspiciously large number of claims for which the statute of limitations has long since expired. Unfortunately, finding a path to the truth of sex harassment charges can often be a perilous journey.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, most professionals structure their interactions with employees of the opposite sex carefully to avoid even the hint of sexual impropriety. Glass-walled office suites are the norm, insuring that employee relationships remain open to public view. The world of \"Mad Men's\" Don Draper and his blatantly sexual overtures to female employees is mostly a thing of the past. Today's sexual harassment is far more subtle.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough legitimate claims deserve compensation, the sex harassment litigation story has a seedy underside. False complaints are sometimes rewarded with generous monetary awards and then hidden from public view with confidentiality agreements and sealing orders.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployment lawyers are accustomed to meeting with CEO clients who are initially defiant and determined to resist a false claim of sexual harassment. They want their reputations and integrity preserved. But when a high-ranking executive is involved, the company rumor vine begins to grow. Depositions are taken. Employees are pulled out of the workplace to back one side or the other. Sterling reputations begin to bleed under the slash of a thousand paper cuts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd of course, the litigation process is expensive for the company. Knowing this, experienced lawyers often urge even the innocent accused executive to agree to mediate claims informally and avoid the possibility of a very public and very embarrassing federal lawsuit. Legitimate victims are also urged to settle rather than risk losing at trial.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce mediation begins, the parties are told that public humiliation and legal costs can be avoided with a quiet, confidential settlement. Both plaintiff and defendant are simultaneously silenced by the agreement's penalty provisions. The truth of the claims will never be tested in any public forum.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is, unless the accused decides to run for public office. Then it appears the art of the leak can undermine the solidity of even the most carefully drafted of confidentiality agreements.\n\n\n\n\n\nHerman Cain said he never consented to the mediation process. The National Restaurant Association, through its board, might have negotiated its own deal with the two women who made allegations of sexual misconduct against Cain to avoid bad publicity and legal costs. Businesses will often \"settle and seal\" the case rather than endure the expense and embarrassment of defending even a falsely accused chief executive.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the sketchy reported accounts, the initial case against Cain might have been paper-thin. There is no assertion of overt sexual contact between him and the female employees in question. The website Politico, which broke the story, refers to witness accounts of episodes of conversations filled with \"innuendo\" and of \"physical gestures that were not overtly sexual\" but which made female employees feel uncomfortable.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo one who has followed Cain", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- George Harrison's", "paragraphs": [{"context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- George Harrison's closest friends and family gathered in Hollywood on Tuesday to dedicate the late Beatle's star on the Walk of Fame.\n\nFrom left, musicians Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne and Paul McCartney join Harrison's relatives for dedication of his star.\n\n\"There's someone here from every important stage of George's life and career,\" Harrison's widow, Olivia, said.\n\nHarrison, who was 58 when he died of cancer in 2001, becomes the second Beatle with a Hollywood star.

Most people don't realize how fast the time goes, but I turned those questions on myself.\"\n\n\n\nThough he quickly points out that he didn't dwell on those questions, Ripken admits it got him thinking, and eventually planning, so that when retirement came in 2001, the shift from baseball to business was easy.\n\n\n\n\"From the outside, I'm sure it looked like a smooth transition just by virtue of the fact that I had another thing to go into,\" he said. \"I had prepared for what was next.\"\n\n\n\nThese days, five seasons after retiring from a 21-year career he spent with the Baltimore Orioles, Ripken is a businessman, team owner, radio-show host and author. He also will be a baseball analyst for TBS, which like CNN.com is owned by Time Warner.\n\n\n\nRipken jumped full time into his company, Ripken Baseball, without taking any break, lessening the emotional jolt of retirement.\n\n\n\n\"I didn't give myself the luxury of taking a month off [after the baseball season],\" he said. \"I think I would have opened myself up to regret, thinking about the past. I had to get a minor league baseball team in that stadium. I just put my head down and started working.\"\n\n\n\nRipken's first post-baseball venture was developing a youth ballpark in his hometown of Aberdeen, Maryland, financed in part by a $75,000 gift from the Major League Baseball Players Association. It was presented to him the night he broke Lou Gehrig's record for consecutive games played.\n\n\n\nRipken was a \"rookie\" for the second time in his life, this time in business. \"I was learning all over again, learning what was important,\" he said. \"The off-season never went by so fast.

Chip Cravaack, R-Minnesota, requires the Transportation Security Administration to study ways to speed up screening of service members and, to the extent possible, their families, when the service members are in uniform and traveling on orders.\n\n\n\n\n\nCravaack, a 24-year Navy veteran and former Northwest Airlines pilot, was inspired to introduce the bill after witnessing a soldier remove his boots while going through security at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It seemed way too excessive for someone who was obviously a patriot serving his country,\" said the congressman's spokesman, Michael Bars.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new law was signed just days after two incidents involving the same soldier at airports in North Carolina and Texas.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to court records, Trey Scott Atwater, a 30-year-old Army Green Beret, had a military smoke grenade in his bag when he was leaving Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Christmas Eve headed for Texas. He was allowed to continue on his trip.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, he was arrested at Midland International Airport in Texas on his return trip when TSA screeners found an undisclosed amount of C-4 explosives in his bag. Authorities said Atwater did not have a detonator and initiator, that it would not have been possible to detonate the explosives, and that it did not appear he was up to anything nefarious.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was not immediately clear how any checkpoint changes would impact cases like Atwater's. Bars said the new law is intended to expedite screening, but not reduce security. Currently, the TSA expedites screening for trusted travelers by dedicating a special line for them, and by allowing them to keep their shoes on and keep laptops in their carry-on bags.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new law says the TSA should establish guidelines for screening travelers in military uniforms and combat boots, and consider incorporating military personnel into trusted traveler programs that give preference to passengers who undergo pre-screening. Nothing in the law prohibits additional screening of the service member if intelligence or law enforcement information indicates that additional screening is necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November, TSA Administrator John Pistole told CNN that he was already working on ways to expedite screening for service members. The TSA was starting to tests its ability to scan military ID cards, known as \"Common Access Cards,\" at a regional airport in Monterey, CA.\n\n\n\n\n\nPistole said the TSA test would not immediately result in quicker screening for service members. But if tests are successful, \"we hope to expand that to airports that would have a large number of military personnel traveling through them,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporters of the initiative said that by expediting the screening of military personnel, the TSA will have more time to focus on unknown travelers who could present a higher risk.\"", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Hundreds of militants", "paragraphs": [{"context": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Hundreds of militants, believed to be foreign fighters, launched attacks on various military check posts in Pakistan's border with Afghanistan Saturday night and early Sunday morning, military officials said.\n\n\n\nA Pakistan soldier on patrol last fall against militants on the border of the Mohmand agency district.\n\n\n\nThe ensuing fighting left 40 militants and six Pakistan soldiers dead, said military spokesman Gen.

Peter W. Chiarelli, vice chief of staff of the Army, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Military Personnel Subcommittee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it is the cumulative effect of deployments from 12 to 15 months,\" he said, adding that the longer deployments are scheduled to continue until June.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe cited long deployments, lengthy separations from family and the perceived stigma associated with seeking help as factors contributing to the suicides.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdm.

He expressed optimism that that tactic would pay off, but he said he had no data to support his expectation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Gen. William M.

Chiarelli said the Army tallied 133 confirmed suicides last year and is still investigating another seven possible ones. At least 70 percent of the suicides had \"some kind of relationship problem,\" he said. Often, the situation was worsened by something else, such as a financial or legal problem, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it wasn't just the trauma of war that appears to heighten the risk. The suicides were about evenly divided among those who had returned from deployment, those who were still deployed -- some on a third or fourth tour -- and those who had never been deployed, Chiarelli said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of the military leaders said they had too few mental health professionals in their ranks.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Walsh said professionals are not the only people who must be trained to intervene, noting that it is often the shipmate or the battle buddy who seeks assistance for someone in need.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Navy counselors are now asking family members for feedback that often proves more illuminating than what the sailors themselves are willing to impart, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If I survey the family, I'm going to get a different set of answers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOne reason some service personnel are reluctant to seek help from their chain of command is because they fear they will then be passed over for promotions, the panel members said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, they pay out of their own pockets to seek help privately, Rubenstein said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd others call civilian hotlines, one of which reported getting three calls per day this year from active-duty military personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepresentatives of all of the branches of the military said they have seen recent increases in suicides.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the Pentagon, Defense Secretary William Gates said he believes the 15-month deployments \"were a real strain\" on many, but expressed optimism that beneficial changes are in the works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All the services are are addressing this problem, but the Army in particular, I think, is really going after it in a very aggressive way,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut some suicides appear to defy all prevention efforts.

An unusual aspect of the show was that traditional Detroit nameplates such as General Motors sat next to competitors from other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe event was organized by Bright Automotive, a small carmaker from Anderson, Indiana, to showcase its IDEA, a new, 100-mpg plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that it hopes to market for government and commercial fleets. In a statement, the company said it has applied for funding through the federal Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther manufacturers took advantage of the opportunity to bring their own vehicles to the public display, in a parking lot near the Russell Senate Office Building.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the Bush administration, Japanese automakers complained they weren't invited to a similar demonstration near the Treasury Department, despite having brought their alternative-energy cars more swiftly to the U.S. market than the Detroit automakers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut neither the competition nor the threat of bankruptcy held back the enthusiasm of a General Motors product spokesman at Tuesday's display. \"If anything, it's just a little bit of noise in the background,\" said Tony Posawatz, a GM vehicle line director.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe told CNN the automaker places high on its recovery agenda the line of Volt electric cars expected to come to market by November 2010.

Most of us know that if left unchecked, these piles of dirty clothes can grow until they're on the brink of becoming sentient beings, but students at Davidson, an elite liberal arts college in North Carolina, don't have to worry about it. Their college does the laundry for them.\n\n\n\nSince 1919, Davidson has been operating a laundry facility that allows students to drop off their laundry and pick it up once its clean and smelling of dryer sheets. At the Lula Bell Houston Laundry, students' dress shirts and blouses are even pressed and put on hangers for them.\n\n\n\nThe laundry clears about six tons' worth of dirty clothes and linens a week, but if students prefer to keep their filthy T-shirts to themselves, the school also offers free self-service washers and dryers in the dorms.\n\n\n\nAs if that's not enough, Davidson was even more generous when its basketball team made a miraculous run to the NCAA's Sweet 16 last March. The school shelled out the cash for free bus transport to the venue in Detroit, two nights' lodging, and a free ticket to the game for any student who wanted to go cheer on their Cinderella in person.

Free skiing\n\n\n\nMichigan Technological University offers a pretty standard slate of majors for its students, but it also has a real estate holding that might lure in applicants. The school owns Mont Ripley, a ski slope on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. While normal lift-ticket prices run at around $35 a day, Michigan Tech students can hit the slopes without dropping a dime.\n\n\n\n3. Free computers\n\n\n\nAt my undergrad alma mater, Wake Forest, one of the chief perks is that when you showed up for freshman orientation, the school gives you a fully loaded IBM Thinkpad and a printer. Students keep this laptop for two years, then trade it in for a new model before their junior year. Students then take this one with them when they graduate.\n\n\n\nWhile there was a downside to the system (if profs know everyone has a laptop, they're not the least bit shy about making you tote it to class), it really upped the on-campus computing efficiency. Any program you needed for a class was already loaded on the laptop, and since everyone on campus was operating one of only two types of machines, tech support could diagnose problems and fix them really quickly.

Because when a CBT tires of you, he won't just say \"see ya,\" he'll decimate you.\n\n\n\nHank Moody (\"Californication\"): Some boys take longer than usual to grow out of their Charles Bukowski-wannabe phase. Exhibit A is Hank Moody. Actor David Duchovny, playing what the tabloids would have you believe is an autobiographical role, has managed to hang onto his Bukowski-phase well into his forties. Drinking, partying, and resisting monogamy, Hank still manages to attract more ladies than hotter men half his age.\n\n\n\nOf course the only women drawn to Hank are either damaged girls with daddy issues or the type of dame who doesn't feel complete unless she has some mess to clean up after. If you see yourself dating a Hank Moody type, do not walk -- run -- to your nearest mental health professional.\n\n\n\nVince Chase (\"Entourage\"): Those big blue eyes and that floppy mop o' hair...  you can forgive him for making a stinker like \"Medellin,\" can't you? Sure, but do you really want to deal with someone who lives in a dude cocoon? Not only does he live with his brother and two best friends, he can't make any decisions without polling the group.\n\n\n\nOn the upside, he's rich! On the downside, he's famous, which means other women are throwing themselves at him constantly. Vince might be fun for a fling, but forget about bringing him home to mama.\n\n\n\nDon Draper (\"Mad Men\"): Why is it when unattractive people are quiet we just assume they're stupid and/or boring, but verbally challenged hot people get pegged as mysterious and smoldering?\n\n\n\nMad Men's smokin' hot Don Draper actually is mysterious (and smoldering!), so I don't know what point I was trying to make (because I'm all distracted from the photos on his IMDB page)... oh, wait! The point I'm trying to make is that while Draper is indeed mysterious, he's also a liar, a cheat and a cad. So if a DDT tries to slip you his number, just say no and send it to me. What?

The drilling here is being watched closely in Louisiana and Pennsylvania, which also have natural gas fields under urban areas.

They say that for most people, the payouts are modest.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much money residents get depends on how much property they own and how much gas -- if any -- is found. The dollar figure also depends on each resident's negotiating skills with energy companies, experts say. The money can range from a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a divide and conquer strategy by going around and giving everybody enough money to keep them quiet.

Nonetheless, the movie's $55.7 million take (including $5.5 million from 124 IMAX screens) is substantially smaller than the $70.9 million that 300, the last R-rated graphic-novel movie from director Zack Snyder, earned on its opening weekend two years ago.\n\nAnd aside from that theater-count statistic (which almost any film could break at any time, really), there will be no major records to report on this weekend (for example, \"Watchmen's\" debut was just the fifth-best opening ever for an R-rated movie).\n\nI'd argue, in fact, that this opening is a bit soft, considering the great expectations that came with Snyder's adaptation of Alan Moore's landmark comic book -- not to mention \"Watchmen's\" hefty grosses from screenings at midnight on Friday and throughout its first day. After attracting some major initial interest, banking $25.1 million on Friday, the film's audience dropped off dramatically during the weekend: It grossed $19 million on Saturday and is expected to bring in just $11.5 million on Sunday.\n\nThese are all big numbers, don't get me wrong, but, when combined with the fact that the film got a lukewarm CinemaScore grade of B from an audience that was largely comprised of older men, it all points to a rapid downward trend that may be difficult to reverse in the weeks to come.\n\nElsewhere -- yes, there were other movies playing at the multiplex this weekend! -- a number of films continued to do what \"Watchmen\" must now aspire to, perhaps in vain: They stayed strong deep into their long runs.\n\nTyler Perry's \"Madea Goes to Jail\" (No. 2) grossed $8.8 million on its third weekend; the film, Perry's biggest yet at the box office, has banked $76.5 million to date.\n\n\"Taken\" (No. 3) also moved along like the unstoppable force it has been for more than a month now, earning $7.5 million and bringing its six-week sum to $118 million.\n\nBest Picture winner \"Slumdog Millionaire\" (No. 4) was next with $6.9 million, which boosted its domestic haul to $125.4 million. And \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" (No. 5) took its eight-week total to $133.6 million thanks to another $4.2 million gross. iReport.com: What did you think of 'Watchmen'?\n\nMeanwhile, \"Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience\" (No. 9) completely fell off the map, dropping a staggering 78 percent to gross just $2.8 million.

The survey of parents was conducted by the Health Resources and Services Administration, and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\n\nThe results are based on a national telephone survey of more than 78,000 parents of children ages 3 to 17.iReport.com: How has autism affected your family?\n\n\n\nIn the study, parents were asked whether a health care provider had ever told them their child had an autism spectrum disorder. ASD is a group of brain disorders comprising autism and two less severe disorders: Asperger's disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified.\n\n\n\nChildren with the disorder show impairment in social interaction and in their ability to communicate. They often display repetitive behavior.  Watch families discuss autism \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe investigators also asked a follow-up question: Were the children considered to have ASD now? Nearly 40 percent of the parents and guardians said no.\n\n\n\nThat finding led the authors to question whether some of the children originally diagnosed as having ASD may have been improperly diagnosed, since the disorders are not considered curable.\n\n\n\nBut Kogan said the two surveys cannot be compared because the earlier investigators did not ask the follow-up question about whether the children were still considered to have the disorder.\n\n\n\nStill, based on the findings, lead author Dr. Michael D. Kogan of HRSA's maternal and child health bureau estimated the prevalence of ASD among U.S. children ages 3 to 17 at 110 per 10,000 -- slightly more than 1 percent.\n\n\n\nBoys were four times as likely as girls to have ASD, and non-Hispanic black and multiracial children were less likely than non-Hispanic white children.\n\n\n\nHe estimated that 673,000 children have ASD in the United States.\n\n\n\nMonday's findings of nearly 1 in 100 appear to indicate an increase from the average of 1 in 150 that was reported in 2003, the researchers said.\n\n\n\nThe researchers urged caution in interpreting the change, noting that an increase in diagnoses does not necessarily mean that more children have the disorder. It could simply reflect a heightened awareness of the disorder.\n\n\n\n\"We don't know whether the change in the number over time is a result of the change in the actual condition, in the actual number of conditions or in part due to the fact that the condition is being recognized differently,\" Arias said.\n\n\n\nShe said that preliminary results from a separate, CDC-funded study she is working on also indicate that about 1 percent of children in the United States are affected by ASD.

Among them: There may be very few African-Americans in Silicon Valley, but despite this Silicon Valley is a pure meritocracy, and one becomes successful because he or she has a \"big brain.\" Vivek disagreed. As an Indian-American entrepreneur, he said he sees significant bias in Silicon Valley, and even recounted a specific instance where he was told, \"You people don't make good CEOs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let me say, I think Arrington truly believes everything he has said about the tech world being a meritocracy. Lots of people believe it.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut not me. I would more properly say that tech markets are a meritocracy. There are very few businesses where an individual in his or her bedroom can create a piece of software that can potentially touch millions of people, and do this without seeking any additional capital. No matter how talented you are, if you want to open a hot new restaurant or a shoe factory, you need lots of money before you start. Not necessarily so with software.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumers and businesses, for the most part, don't care about the ethnicity of their software or Internet service vendor. Users want solutions. So if an entrepreneur can get a great product completed cheaply, he or she can often compete on a totally even footing with anyone else. Even if the entrepreneur ultimately needs capital, explosive initial success knocks down all known barriers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the market makers operate in a world that is not particularly evenhanded. The market makers are the folks who help new young companies and entrepreneurs by providing insight, mentoring, capital and relationships. This part of the tech world is driven by all the same biases that exist in the nontech world. And it is much harder for even the most talented African-Americans in the tech world to gain access to influential, insightful, connected mentors, let alone investors.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is this? For the most part, people want to work with people who are \"like them\" or who fit a pattern that appeals to them. There is an actual term for this among tech investors called \"pattern matching.\" It's the idea that, without objective facts, one can decide whether someone is likely to be successful based on indirect criteria. In other words, when they see a particular pattern of \"personhood,\" they are excited.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch trailer for CNN documentary \"The New Promised Land: Silicon Valley\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThese patterns are discussed openly in the tech industry around issues like age. Since it is only moderately politically incorrect to suggest that younger entrepreneurs are \"better,\" it is done all the time. The best example of this might be Mike Moritz from Sequoia Capital, perhaps the most influential of all venture funds, admitting in a Building 43 interview that they have a strong bias toward very young entrepreneurs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if you believe that age is the only criteria that venture capitalists use for pattern matching, I wanna smoke some of what you've got.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be clear, I am not saying any venture capitalist says at a partner meeting, \"You know I really like this company's product, but did you notice he's a Negro?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNever happens.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I firmly believe, based on my 25 years in this industry, that market makers, both investors and the people who help you get ready to approach them, seek out entrepreneurs who appeal to them on some less than objective, visceral level, who feel \"comfortable\" to them. They don't need to actively filter out undesirable profiles. They just focus on what does appeal to them.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoledad O'Brien: Michael Arrington is right (about one thing)\n\n\n\n\n\nThey focus on the \"patterns\" they find appealing -- age is arguably a part of ", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sailors aboard a U.S. ocean su", "paragraphs": [{"context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sailors aboard a U.S. ocean surveillance ship reacted with a mix of bemusement and profanity to what they said was harassment by Chinese ships earlier this month, according to video released Friday by the Pentagon.\n\n\n\nThe Navy says this shows a trawler crew member using a hook to try to snag the Impeccable's towed acoustic array.\n\n\n\n\"Chinese aggression, from aboard the USNS Impeccable,\" one member of the American ship's crew is heard narrating. \"Details at 11.\"\n\n\n\nThe Pentagon has raised concerns about a March 8 incident in which \"increasingly aggressive\" Chinese ships harassed the Impeccable, an unarmed survey ship with a mostly civilian crew.\n\n\n\nChina's government accused the ship of violating Chinese and international laws during its patrols, which took place more than 100 miles off the Chinese coast.\n\n\n\n\"The U.S. claims are gravely in contravention of the facts and confuse black and white and they are totally unacceptable to China,\" Ma Zhaoxu, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said after news of the incident emerged.\n\n\n\nFive Chinese vessels shadowed the Impeccable, with two of them closing to within 25 feet while their crews waved Chinese flags and stripped down to their underwear in a sign of disrespect.

Critics delighted in her haughty, serpent-tongued deliveries.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer first television appearance came in 1951 in a long-forgotten series called \"Once Upon a Tune,\" but she quickly made a name for herself with appearances on \"Studio One,\" \"Kraft Television Theatre\" and \"The Sid Caesar Show.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nArthur drew attention in \"Threepenny Opera\" on Broadway with Lotte Lenya, but she really turned heads in 1964 originating the role of Yente the Matchmaker in \"Fiddler on the Roof.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1966, Arthur won a Tony Award for the caustic Vera Charles in the play \"Mame,\" playing opposite Angela Lansbury in the title role. Eight years later, she reprised the role in the film version opposite Lucille Ball, but by then she was already well-established as Maude.\n\n\n\n\n\nArthur left \"Maude\" in 1978, making television and some film appearances afterward. She starred in a short-lived series, \"Amanda's,\" in 1983 and then joined the cast of \"The Golden Girls\" in 1985 with Betty White, Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer role as Dorothy Zbornak gave Arthur her other major television success as one of four older women living together in Florida. (Getty played Arthur's mother). The role earned Arthur a second Emmy -- the first was for \"Maude.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nArthur left the show after Dorothy remarried at the end of the 1991-92 season. White, McClanahan and Getty continued for another season on the show, renamed \"The Golden Palace,\" but the show lasted only one season without Arthur.\n\n\n\n\n\nArthur entered semi-retirement after the show ended in 1992, returning to television in sporadic guest appearances and appearing at several celebrity roasts.

He knew it would draw the gunman's attention and divert his line of sight from others.\n\n\n\nBurnette said he wasn't trying to play a hero.\n\n\n\n\"There are guys overseas doing more than what I did,\" he said. \"I just happened to be at a certain place at a certain time in the world and hopefully I made a difference.\"\n\n\n\nBut that's when he got hit. He took a round that pierced his hip on the left side and tore through his abdomen.\n\n\n\n\"After the hit, I fell down, not even realizing I had been hit,\" he said. \"As I tried to get back up, I was shot in the elbow on the left arm and ... the knuckle on the left pinky finger.\"\n\n\n\nHe was like a wounded animal desperate to escape the hunter's aim.\n\n\n\n\"He wanted to kill all of us,\" Burnette said. \"We were all unarmed.\"\n\n\n\nBurnette's gut felt like a knife slicing through it.

His father Surinder and elder brother Boney are film producers, his daughter Sonam, sister-in-law Sridevi and his younger brother Sanjay are actors, while son-in-law Sandeep Marwah is a movie magnate and Anil's son Harshvardhan is currently learning to direct movies in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nBut things weren't always so glamorous. Anil Kapoor was born on Christmas Eve 1959 and grew up in a tenement in the Mumbai suburb of Chembur, with eight people living together in a single room. His father Surinder had yet to make his name in the film industry, but young Anil clearly had movies in his blood. \"In my childhood I was surrounded by films, actors, film makers, directors and film talk. I would bunk school to watch movies,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHe was cast in his first movie aged just seven. Although the film was never released, the experience was enough to convince Kapoor that his future lay in the movies.\n\n\n\nAfter finishing school he went to St Xavier's College, where he acted in plays and won the Best Actor trophy at an inter-collegiate competition, before being expelled for non-attendance. Kapoor responded by enrolling in acting classes and taking singing and dance lessons.\n\n\n\nHe made his Bollywood debut in 1979's \"Hamare Tumhare,\" before moving on to Telugu-language movie \"Vamsa Vriksham\" in 1980, and landing his first Bollywood starring role in 1983's \"Woh 7 Din.\"\n\n\n\nWatch Anil Kapoor take CNN on a tour of Mumbai. \u00bb\n\n\n\nKapoor first met future wife Sunita Bhambhani in 1979, when she was a successful model and he was still a struggling actor. He decided that he would propose marriage as soon as he got his big break and 1984's \"Mashaal\" was the opportunity he'd been waiting for. Kapoor's performance won him Best Supporting Actor at India's prestigious FilmFare awards and he married Sunita in May of that year.\n\n\n\nKapoor cemented his status a Bollywood idol after starring in the hugely successful \"Mr India,\" which promptly became his nickname among a growing legion of fans. He has gone on to become one of the biggest names in Indian cinema, picking up a total of five FilmFare awards and a National Film Institute Best Actor award for his role in 2000's \"Pukar.\"\n\n\n\nFollowing in his father's footsteps, Kapoor made his debut as a producer in 2002, with the comedy \"Badhaai Ho Badhaai,\" and he went on to produce \"Gandhi, My Father,\" which portrayed the fractious relationship between Mohandas Gandhi and his eldest son Harilal.\n\n\n\nFor years now, in his home town of Mumbai Kapoor has been mobbed by fans wherever he goes, instantly recognizable by his trademark mustache, which he has proudly sported in all but three of his hundred-plus movies.\n\n\n\nBut like most Bollywood stars, he received little acclaim outside India. That changed abruptly and unexpectedly with the release of low-budget British movie \"Slumdog Millionaire.\" The film has become an international sensation, winning four Golden Globe awards and receiving an astonishing 10 Oscar nominations.\n\n\n\nSee Anil Kapoor's \"Slumdog Millionaire\" success in photos. \u00bb\n\n\n\nKapoor's role as the creepy quiz show host earned him a share in the Screen Actors Guild award for Best Cast.

Even the setting, though new, will be familiar to most readers: Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\nThis time, Langdon is lured to the Capitol to save his mentor, Peter Solomon, a prominent member of the Freemasons who's been kidnapped by a cryptic, heavily tattooed, Homer-reading psycho calling himself Mal'akh -- a vicious fellow even less plausible than the albino monk in \"The Da Vinci Code.\"\n\n\n\nOur hero is also in possession of an ancient Masonic artifact whose clues lead him on a treasure hunt to various D.C. tourist spots as he searches for a secret long hidden by the brotherhood.  Watch the frenzy surrounding \"The Lost Symbol\" \u00bb\n\n\n\nThat secret, of course, is one giant MacGuffin -- though Brown is the rare thriller writer who seems to lavish as much attention on the object that sets his plot in motion as he does on the action itself.\n\n\n\nBut for thriller fans, it's the chase that really matters. Especially since the secrets of Freemasonry just aren't as compelling as, say, a controversial theory about Mary Magdalene and Jesus.\n\n\n\nLuckily, Langdon remains a terrific hero, a bookish intellectual who's cool in a crisis and quick on his feet, like Ken Jennings with a shot of adrenaline. The codes are intriguing, the settings present often-seen locales in a fresh light, and Brown mostly manages to keep the pages turning -- except when one of his know-it-all characters decides to brake the action for another superfluous, if occasionally interesting, historical digression. (Did you know there's a carving of Darth Vader on the National Cathedral?)\n\n\n\nEven after the book's climactic showdown, you must slog through another 50-plus pages of exposition that Brown couldn't cram into the main narrative.

In the attacks that started in April 1994, Hutu militias and members of the general population sought out Tutsis and moderate Hutus -- and went on a 100-day killing rampage.\n\n\n\nIn June of 1994, Rwanda was still in the grip of a 100-day killing rampage.\n\n\n\nCivilians and children got incentives to take part in the atrocities, including promises of land belonging to their Tutsi neighbors.\n\n\n\nIt was one of the most brutal genocides in modern history. Some figures put the number of dead at 1 million, 10 percent of the population of the central African nation. Millions more were raped and disfigured. A whole generation of children lost their parents.\n\n\n\nWhat started the Tutsi and Hutu rivalry\n\n\n\nThe Tutsi ethnic minority and the Hutu majority had been at odds even before 1994. The rivalry started during colonial times, when the Belgians considered Tutsis the privileged ethnicity, thus giving them better opportunities.\n\n\n\nThe Hutus were considered inferior, prompting resentment that was passed on through the generations. The first major assault on Tutsis occurred in 1959, killing thousands and prompting more attacks over the years.\n\n\n\nThe animosity caused the Tutsis to flee to neighboring countries, including Burundi and Uganda. The Hutus took over the government when Rwanda gained its independence from Belgium in 1962, but the resentment remained.\n\n\n\nHours before the genocide\n\n\n\nIn early April, a plane carrying then-President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, was shot down near the capital, Kigali. The president, his Burundian counterpart and their aides were killed. A few hours later, Rwanda erupted into chaos.\n\n\n\nSome have accused current President Paul Kagame, a Tutsi, of masterminding the killing. Kagame, who led a Tutsi militia group at the time, has denied any ties. He has accused Hutu rebels of instigating the assassinations to incite fury and attacks on Tutsis.\n\n\n\nDifferences between Hutus and Tutsis\n\n\n\nThey speak the same language and practice the same customs. However, most Tutsis are considered tall and lanky, which has led to speculation that they have Ethiopian heritage. During the genocide, the bodies of Tutsis were thrown into rivers by the Hutus, who said they were sending them back to Ethiopia.\n\n\n\nThe aftermath of the genocide\n\n\n\nAfter 100 days of death and destruction, the Tutsi militia led by Kagame defeated the Hutu rebels and took control of the government. Scores of Hutus fled to neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, where they have been accused of inciting more violence. Rwanda has invaded Congo various times to launch an offensive against Hutus allegedly linked to the genocide.\n\n\n\nAfter the cease-fire, a multiethnic government made up of Hutu President Pasteur Bizimungu and Vice President Kagame came into power. Bizimungu was later accused of ethnic discord and jailed. Kagame became president in 2000.\n\n\n\nTrials for genocide suspects\n\n\n\nTop officials such as army generals and politicians who allegedly took part in the genocide are tried in the Rwandan justice system and the International Criminal Tribunal, which is based in Tanzania. Civilians who allegedly contributed either directly or indirectly are tried in gacaca courts.\n\n\n\nThe latter are community courts conducted by a panel of nine civilians in an open field.\n\n\n\nThe courts allow survivors to point out and confront their attackers. Gacaca means \"open grass\" in the local language. Human rights organizations say the gacacas fall short on delivering justice.\n\n\n\nState of the nation 15 years later\n\n\n\nRwanda is now considered one of Africa's most stable nations. Education, health care, tourism and trade -- which were destroyed in the genocide -- have improved dramatically. Kagame has made big strides against corruption, a major problem in Africa.\n\n\n\nHowever, critics have accused him of being an autocratic leader who has stifled the country's media.

He spoke to more than 400 executives representing a wide range of industries including petroleum, engineering and construction, commercial aviation, architecture, maritime cargo and financial services.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs U.S. investment in Iraq has increased since 2008, al-Maliki said Iraq wants to see a much greater presence of U.S. companies in his country to help spur greater spending and investment on the country's infrastructure as a way to better the lives of Iraqis and create more U.S. jobs in the process.\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal foreign direct investment in Iraq hit $70 billion for the first months of 2011, according to the chamber.

He assured his audience that his government was doing all it could to root out corruption and make the country safe for businesses to operate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Make no mistake, this is a country that's developing, its commerce is developing, it's going to take time, it's going to take energy,\" Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides told CNN after al-Maliki spoke. \"U.S. companies are going there because they believe they can make money and at the end of the day that's what it is about, and most of these companies have dealt with complicated environments.

As many as 5 percent of Americans are at risk for a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction from insect stings, according to the organization.\n\n\n\nIn a typical week in the emergency room, doctors at Emory University Hospital Midtown in Atlanta, Georgia, see about six or fewer cases of people with allergic reactions to insects, said Dr. James P. Capes, director of the emergency department.\n\n\n\n\"It's common, but not incredibly common,\" he said.\n\n\n\nTypically, when stung by an insect, a person will have no reaction or a mild local reaction, such as redness, swelling or itching at the site of the sting. However, some people experience a more widespread reaction, such as a drop in blood pressure, lightheadedness or hives all over. iReport.com: Send us your allergy stories\n\n\n\nIn the most serious cases, a person can go into anaphylaxis, a condition in which he or she may have difficulty breathing. Other symptoms include swelling of the mouth or throat, itchy skin, wheezing, cough and localized pain, said Dr. Clifford Bassett, medical director of Allergy and Asthma Care of New York.\n\n\n\nCapes advises people who experience a systemic reaction to call 911 and wait for an ambulance, because it will have medicine to treat the reaction immediately. An antihistamine such as Benadryl will be given and, in severe cases, a shot of epinephrine.\n\n\n\nEven if the reaction is not severe, Benadryl will help with normal symptoms of insect stings, Capes said.\n\n\n\nThose who have had allergic reactions to insects should always carry an antihistamine and an epinephrine auto-injector for emergencies, experts said.\n\n\n\nInsect allergies may be harder to control than some food allergies because it's not always possible to predict when bees, wasps and other stinging bugs are around, Capes said.\n\n\n\nSevere reactions don't usually happen the very first time a person gets stung, Capes said.\n\n\n\n\"The thing about allergic reactions that is interesting, or scary, is that we never know what the next allergic reaction is going to be,\" he said.\n\n\n\nFor those who have a history of anaphylactic reactions to insects, vaccines are available for yellow jackets, wasps, honey bees and fire ants, Bassett said. The immunization process takes three to five years, he said.\n\n\n\nThere are also blood and skin tests that people can take to determine whether they are sensitive to these insects, he said.\n\n\n\nBesides anaphylaxis, people may experience other kinds of reactions, Bassett said. If a person is stung hundreds of times at once, he or she may need emergency care, as the venom may lead to seizures, shock and even death, he said.\n\n\n\nThere is also a rare reaction called serum sickness that includes joint pain and flu-like illness that may result from insect stings, and has allergy-like symptoms, Bassett said.\n\n\n\nIn rare cases, even mosquito bites can lead to anaphylaxis, Bassett said. There is no treatment for mosquito allergies, but there is a diagnostic test, he said.\n\n\n\nBassett offers the following tips to reduce the danger of insects:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Stay away from stinging insect nests when possible.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Consider wearing closed-toed shoes in an area where there may be many stinging insects.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Remain calm and quiet around a stinging insect, and move slowly away from it.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Avoid brightly colored clothing, as well as perfumes and scented hair products and lotions.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Avoid loose-fitting clothing, which can accidentally ", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- Remains found last week ", "paragraphs": [{"context": "ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- Remains found last week in a wooded area have been identified as belonging to missing Florida toddler Caylee Anthony, authorities said Friday.\n\n\n\nCaylee Anthony, 2, had been missing since June in a case that has received national attention.\n\n\n\nThe cause of the child's death will be listed as homicide by undetermined means, said Jan Garavaglia, medical examiner for Orange County, Florida.

At the Worry Free Dinners event, \"not only was the food phenomenal, but it's wonderful to have an opportunity to interact with other families who are dealing with similar issues.\"\n\n\n\nThe recent \"worry free\" meal event took place just days before the Food and Drug Administration's September 16 public hearing on food ingredient labels. Since 2006, food manufacturers have been required to clearly label products that contain any of the most common allergens -- milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat and soy -- but some allergy experts say the labels should be more explicit.\n\n\n\nRestaurant dining can be a terrifying experience for people with severe food allergies.

As far as she knows, Worry Free Dinners is the first event series of its kind.\n\n\n\nExperts agree that allergies in general -- both food and inhalant -- are on the rise, but no one is sure why. Research on food allergies has been slow because \"for a long time, people thought this was a small problem,\" Munoz-Furlong said. The largest group of studies on the subject are in progress, including immunotherapy for people with peanut and milk allergies, she said.\n\n\n\nThe majority of food allergy cases -- about 80 percent -- are \"cyclic,\" with mild symptoms that resemble those of pollen or dust allergies: sneezing, itchy eyes, and nasal congestion, said Dr. Alpen Patel, assistant professor of otolaryngology at Emory University.

Is there a \"tourist trap\" that's actually worth seeing?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest tourist trap is Plaza Garibaldi, were the mariachis are awful and you can get mugged. A trap that could be worth seeing is the area called Xochimilco, often called \"Mexican Venice\" because of a series of canals.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere was your most memorable meal?

The agreement was sent to Misty Cummings' lawyer for her signature.\n\n\n\n\"He really didn't come to us and say, 'I want to file for divorce,'\" said another of Ronald Cummings' attorneys, Brandon Beardsley. \"My understanding is that this is something that he and Misty have been discussing for the last few days and they're contemplating it because they ultimately feel that it is in the best interest for both of them.\"\n\n\n\nMisty Cummings' attorney, Robert Fields, told CNN he has not talked with his client and doesn't know her thoughts regarding the divorce. Fields said he had received the papers via e-mail but had not had a chance to review them.

His nonprofit, Faith*Hope*Love*Charity, has provided food, housing, counseling, employment and medical services to more than 1,100 veterans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was somewhat overwhelmed at the tribute. To be a part of something that you love doing -- to be honored in doing it was, you know, strange,\" recalled Foster, 54. \"But then to be showcased internationally was tremendous. And it's still reaping benefits today.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong those benefits is Foster's recent opening of the First Stop Resource Center and Housing Program in Palm Beach, Florida. The center and program widen the scope of support services his organization has been offering through its original Stand Down House. They also bring Foster's long-held dream to fruition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Twenty years ago, the dream was to be able to provide assistance and services for homeless veterans and their entire family,\" he said. \"We did come up with Stand Down House 10 years ago, but there was never that support for the family or the female veterans. This year, we've been fortunate enough to complete that vision.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes\n\n\n\n\n\nThe First Stop Resource Center assists veterans and their families through various periods of crises, including homelessness and addiction. Before its addition, Foster and his team had to send veterans in need from one partner aid agency to another over multiple days, in multiple locations -- increasing the risk of losing clients back to the streets.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the new resource center, veterans in need are able to meet with any of First Stop's 15 community aid partners under one roof in a single visit. They can receive assistance with housing, legal, medical care, employment, child care, education, pensions, food stamps and transportation needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We were looking to establish a place where we will not lose them in that process of 'hurry up and wait,' \" Foster said. \"We want to centralize it. We want to get their needs addressed and ... get these service members back out into the community. That's what it's about.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Stop's housing program is geared toward female veterans and veterans with children. Set adjacent to the organization's original Stand Down House for male veterans, the two new residence buildings can provide temporary housing for up to eight single female veterans and two small families. It is only the second transitional housing facility in the nation available to veterans with children, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're trying to empower the family structure, because if the family struggles, the soldier struggles. When the soldier struggles, it puts everyone at risk,\" Foster said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarbara Williams is First Stop's first female resident. An Operation Desert Storm veteran, Williams fell on hard times after losing her job last year. Now, she and her daughters have a roof over their heads and the hope of better days to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My pride is restored,\" said Williams, 40. \"I'm able to just go off to look for jobs and not worry about where am I going to go when I come home. It's just so much relief.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe seed money for the new housing facility arrived shortly after Foster was announced as a Top 10 CNN Hero.

The students get free tuition, free uniforms, free accommodation and free meals at the school in Henley-on-Klip, near Johannesburg.\n\n\n\nIn Hine's case, her children's status as the \"poorest of the poor\" that the school aims to serve was clear-cut: Hine supports the five people who live in her small two-bedroom Soweto home on the $50 a week she makes from a fruit and vegetable stand.

When the body of Mary Phagan, a white child laborer, was found in the basement, law enforcement homed in on Frank. He was tried and convicted, based on what most historians say was the perjured testimony of a black man, and sentenced to death. But when the governor commuted his sentence in 1915, about 25 men abducted Frank, 31, from the state prison and hung him from a tree in Marietta, Georgia.\n\n\n\nConsidered one of the most sensational trials of the early 20th century, the Frank case seemed to press every hot-button issue of the time: North vs. South, black vs. white, Jew vs. Christian, industrial vs. agrarian.\n\n\n\nIn the years since, it has inspired numerous books and films, TV programs, plays, musicals and songs.

Teachers and school staff frequently lack training in correct restraint methods, and in some cases, where improper restraints led to injuries, teachers often kept their jobs.\n\n\n\nOnly five states keep track of incidents where special-needs students are separated or restrained. Parents contacted by CNN commonly said they were not told their child was being disciplined until he or she began to behave badly at home -- a sign of trouble at school.\n\n\n\nWhen confronted with complaints, school systems sometimes sought to minimize or deny the allegations, even after public investigations found the charges to be true. And parents told CNN that when they got into a dispute with the teacher, their child was made to suffer as retribution.\n\n\n\nSome of the most disturbing reports concerned the use of seclusion rooms. Experts have long recommended that children should only be isolated when they pose an immediate threat to themselves or others. But CNN found that isolation was often used as a punishment by teachers to compel the students to follow instructions.\n\n\n\nState investigators in Utah found a teacher left 7-year-old Garrett Peck in an isolation cubicle for at least two and a half hours after the teacher said he told her to \"shut up.\"\n\n\n\nWhile the boy was in the cubicle, the teacher taunted him by playing his favorite video and telling him what he was missing.

He called it \"a smoking gun of confirmation of Brazil's effort to engage in operations to overthrow the government of Chile and a discussion of collusion with the United States.\"\n\n\n\nThe two leaders also discussed the creation of a back channel for direct communication outside normal diplomatic protocols, according to the document. Each designated personal aides to carry handwritten communications back and forth to keep discussions out of official records.\n\n\n\n\"I think there is precedent, but we've never seen it detailed in a document this way, in which two presidents set up the utmost secret of back-channel communications so they can discuss the most sensitive aspects of collusion and collaboration in efforts to challenge the left in Latin America and change the futures of select Latin American governments,\" Kornbluh said.\n\n\n\nHe added that \"there's a significant paper trail of evidence of what that collusion was that remains secret, and we're going to have to press Brazil and Washington to recover those documents.\"\n\n\n\nDespite the leaders' effort to keep the subject of their talks secret, word got out.\n\n\n\nA declassified CIA memorandum written some time after the Nixon-Medici meeting in Washington said that word of the secret talks between the two leaders about shaping Brazilian foreign policy filtered down to Brazilian military officers by a \"Cabinet leak.\" Gen. Vicente Dale Coutinho, commander of Brazil's 4th Army, reacted to this by saying that the United States obviously wanted Brazil \"to do the dirty work,\" it said.\n\n\n\nA declassified CIA national intelligence estimate written in 1972 concluded, \"Brazil will be playing a bigger role in hemispheric affairs and seeking to fill whatever vacuum the U.S. leaves behind. It is unlikely that Brazil will intervene openly in its neighbors' internal affairs, but the regime will not be above using the threat of intervention or tools of diplomacy and covert action to oppose leftist regimes, to keep friendly governments in office, or to help place them there.\"\n\n\n\nThe newly published documents do not offer any conclusive proof of Brazilian involvement in the Chilean coup of 1973, which the Nixon administration supported.\n\n\n\nKornbluh said that with the passage of time and change in governments in all of the countries involved, the real story of diplomatic and covert collusion between the United States and Brazil in Chile can finally be told.\n\n\n\nThe National Security Archive will push for the declassification and publication of more top-secret documents from the Nixon library, he said, and will approach Brazilian government officials to ask for their cooperation in getting documents released in Washington and Brasilia, the capital of ", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- Florida authorities were searching Sunday", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Florida authorities were searching Sunday for a 33-year-old man after his wife and five children were found dead in their Naples home.\n\n\n\nMesac Damas pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor battery against Guerline Damas in June.\n\n\n\nThe bodies of Guerline Damas, 32; Michzach, 9; Marven, 6; Maven, 5; Megan, 3; and Morgan, 11 months, were discovered Saturday, Rambosk said.\n\n\n\nAuthorities have been unable to locate Mesac Damas, who possibly left the country Friday morning and may be in Haiti, Capt.

L-CROSS researchers said about 25 gallons of water were detected in the crater, which measured about 60 feet wide by a few feet deep.\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Wargo, NASA'S chief lunar scientist on the L-CROSS mission, said the probes detected more than water in the crater, but researchers are still trying to understand what the other stuff is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're opening new chapters.

That's not far from absolute zero, defined by international agreement as 273.15 degrees below zero Celsius and a temperature that cannot be physically reached.

Compounding the problem is the release of these snakes by pet owners.\n\n\n\n\"These pets were released by owners that do not understand the threat to the ecosystem,\" Everglades National Park spokeswoman Linda Friar said. She said the pets, which can grow to 200 pounds and live for 30 years, often get too big for owners to handle.\n\n\n\nThe state has a pilot program with several volunteer snake hunters such as Wasilewski.\n\n\n\nTwenty years ago, no Burmese pythons were found in the Everglades, park statistics say. Now, there could be 100,000 snakes in the River of Grass, but no one knows for sure.\n\n\n\nWhat Wasilewski, an expert on reptiles, is sure of is that night is the best time for his hunting, as that is when the snakes tend to be on the move.\n\n\n\nWhen he finds his prey, he puts the snake in a bag, deposits it in a crate and delivers it to biologists for the Everglades National Park, where the snake can be studied and/or destroyed.\n\n\n\nOn one recent evening, the pickings were slim, and after two hours of driving back and forth along the two-lane Tamiami Trail, Wasilewski's crate was empty.

AMD (another American company and Intel's only competitor) first raised the red flag in 2000.\n\n\n\nWhy does the commission have the power to impose such fines?\n\n\n\nEU law does not regard market dominance as illegal, but it is allowed to fine a company that abuses its position as the biggest in any given market. It has a guideline of fining a company based on a percentage of profits.\n\n\n\nEU law is set up to \"protect consumers,\" and the anti-trust office says consumers were hurt. Yet as Intel likes to point out, consumers did not launch this case -- AMD, a competitor, launched this in Europe (and in Japan and South Korea) as the U.S. antitrust officials under George W.

Interestingly, it lost 4 percent of its market share to AMD so far this year.\n\n\n\nThe company says it will appeal -- when is that likely to be heard?\n\n\n\nAnother appeal will take months.

A veteran legislator, Roberto Micheletti, was sworn in that same day as provisional president with the support of congress.\n\n\n\nRoberto Micheletti, the veteran legislator who was sworn in that same day as provisional president with the support of congress, was adamant that Zelaya would not return to power.\n\n\n\n\"He already committed crimes against the constitution and the laws; he can't return to be president of the republic,\" Micheletti told reporters Tuesday. \"He can no longer return to the presidency unless a president from another Latin American country comes and imposes him with arms.\"\n\n\n\nMicheletti added, \"If there is an invasion against our country, we have seven-and-a-half million Hondurans ready to defend our territory and our laws and our homeland and our government.\"\n\n\n\nHowever, Zelaya still vows to defy the provisional government.\n\n\n\n\"I am going to return on Thursday because they expelled me by force, and I am going to return as always: as a citizen and as president,\" Zelaya said at a U.N. news conference shortly after the world body unanimously adopted a resolution that he should be restored to power.\n\n\n\nZelaya, speaking to the U.N. General Assembly, called the resolution historic.\n\n\n\n\"Your servant has several accusations against him in Honduras,\" Zelaya said. \"But nobody has given me a trial. Nobody has convened a tribunal.\"\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Micheletti's provisional government said Zelaya would be arrested if he returned.\n\n\n\n\"As soon as he arrives he will be captured, as we already have the arrest warrants ready,\" new Foreign Minister Enrique Ortez Colindres told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.\n\n\n\nZelaya would face charges of violating the constitution, corruption and drug trafficking, among others, Ortez said.\n\n\n\nThe deposed president said he would travel to Washington to attend a meeting of the Organization of American States. He also is expected to meet Tuesday evening with Tom Shannon, the top U.S. official on Latin America.\n\n\n\nEven as Zelaya spoke at the United Nations, his opponents held a large and noisy rally in Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras. Crowd members waved blue and white Honduran flags and signs denouncing Zelaya.\n\n\n\nRoberto Micheletti, the new provisional president, briefly addressed the crowd Tuesday afternoon. He vowed that the next national elections, slated for November, will be held as planned, and that a new president will be sworn in as usual in January.\n\n\n\nGen. Romeo Vasquez Velasquez, the top Honduran military commander who had butted heads with Zelaya, also spoke at the rally. By removing Zelaya, the armed forces were only complying with their constitutional duties, he said.\n\n\n\nBefore he spoke, the crowd chanted in support, \"Armed forces! Armed forces!\"\n\n\n\nZelaya supporters also were active Tuesday, with three major public-sector labor unions launching a general strike, a union official told CNN. About 100,000 workers joined the strike, said Oscar Garcia, vice president of the Honduran water workers union SANAA. That number could not be independently verified.\n\n\n\n\"It will be an indefinite strike,\" Garcia said. \"We don't recognize this new government imposed by the oligarchy, and we will mount our campaign of resistance until President Manuel Zelaya is restored to power.\"\n\n\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the U.S. State Department said it was reviewing its aid to Honduras as it works with regional partners on a deal to restore Zelaya to power and quell political unrest in the country.\n\n\n\nState Department spokesman Ian Kelly said the U.S. was reviewing whether Zelaya's ouster met the legal definition of a \"coup\" before any decision was made.\n\n\n\n\"Because of the ", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- She stood by her husband throu", "paragraphs": [{"context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- She stood by her husband throughout the contentious 2008 presidential campaign and during heated health care reform debates during his presidency.\n\n\n\nFirst lady Michelle Obama listens to remarks during a health care forum at the White House on Friday.\n\n\n\nNow, as the debate is reaching a fever pitch, first lady Michelle Obama is weighing in on the issue by focusing on how health care can affect families.\n\n\n\n\"What she's doing is putting a personal and human face on the issue ... there's nothing more crucial,\" said Washington Post columnist Sally Quinn. \"Everybody gets sick, and everybody has someone in the family that gets sick.\"\n\n\n\n\"I think if you can humanize it and personalize it, it suddenly brings it home to people -- especially those who are screaming and yelling about the government taking over,\" Quinn said.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, the first lady, a former hospital administrator, spoke about the issue to a crowd at the White House, highlighting her own family's experience with health care.\n\n\n\nIn one touching moment, Obama recalled when daughter Sasha exhibited signs of potentially deadly meningitis when she was 4 months old.\n\n\n\n\"We didn't know what, but he [the doctor] told us she could have meningitis, so we were terrified.

If two women did that, it would be pitched as a cover-up for a more deep[ly] rooted reason.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe actresses themselves seem to accept it as just another part of an oft-dirty business. \"The chemistry among the four of us is very strong, [but] ... the press has to put women in these boxes, rather than show them as the movie portrays them: working together and being powerful,\" Cattrall said in the Marie Claire interview. \"Things just have to be explosive for no other reason than for people's imaginations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA likely reason for the media coverage, explained pop culture expert and \"The Cult of Celebrity\" author Cooper Lawrence, is because \"it's much easier to believe that women don't like each other.

In Germany, consumers have junked more than 1.2 million guzzlers in the last five months and significantly boosted the economy there. So we know that Clunkers programs get the job done. How many other government programs can you say that about?\n\n\n\nThe Senate has joined the House in passing an additional $2 billion for Cash for Clunkers, allowing the program to move forward. This will bring additional buyers to the showroom. One key feature of the Clunkers program is that it is not just $3 billion of new money into the economy. It is injecting $21 billion -- since consumers must bring the rest of the money to pay for the new car. That is a lot of stimulus for the dollar.\n\n\n\nCash for Clunkers is saving jobs up and down the auto supply chain: from dealers to assembly workers and parts markers. Dealerships alone lost 50,000 jobs in the last 18 months and would continue to shed jobs without this program.\n\n\n\nIf you look at the new cars consumers are buying with the program, 45 percent are from Detroit's Big Three automakers. That is a lot of new sales for Ford, GM and Chrysler.\n\n\n\nCash for Clunkers also helps autoworkers across the country. Let's remember that lots of the Toyotas and Hondas sold in the program are made by American workers right here in this country. They are in states such as Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama. This program helps all American autoworkers, not just those up North.\n\n\n\nSome people ask why we should help the auto industry and not other industries in this same way. Cash for Clunkers actually helps all of us -- even those of us who do not participate in the program or work in the auto industry.\n\n\n\nFirst, the auto industry has so many connected jobs in real estate, finance, manufacturing and other industries, that is hard to separate it out.\n\n\n\nSecond, one of the biggest drags on our economy is our trade imbalance. We import about $700 billion more than we export. That hurts our capital flows, credit and other key indicators.\n\n\n\nGuess what amounts to 50 percent of that trade imbalance? Oil. We use 21 million barrels of oil every day in the United States and import 62 percent of that -- mainly from countries that really don't like us. We use that oil mainly for transportation -- cars, SUVs, and other vehicles.\n\n\n\nUnless we scrap guzzlers at a faster rate, we will never reduce our oil consumption. Cash for Clunkers is a step in the right direction. It educates the consumer on how much they are paying for having a low-MPG car and encourages them to get into a more efficient vehicle.\n\n\n\nA family can save $750-$1,000 a year by jumping just 10 mpg in efficiency. Those savings will increase as gas prices go back up. Gas has already shot up from $1.50 a gallon to $2.60. Do you want to be stuck with a 10 mile-per-gallon guzzler when gas jumps back to $4 a gallon?\n\n\n\nThird, Cash for Clunkers saves lives. When you bring in a clunker that has no airbags, anti-lock brakes or other modern safety features and get a new car that does, you are protecting your family. Forty thousand people die every year on American highways and many more get serious injuries.\n\n\n\nYou can reduce ", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- India's lower house of p", "paragraphs": [{"context": "NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- India's lower house of parliament elected a woman as its speaker Wednesday, a first in the male-dominated chamber's history.\n\n\n\nMeira Kumar was nominated by the ruling Congress party.\n\n\n\nMeira Kumar is also a member of the \"untouchable\" Dalit class, the lowest rung in the centuries-old caste system in the country.\n\n\n\nThe speaker conducts the proceedings of the house.

Glenn McConnell, Senate president pro tempore, didn't explicitly ask Sanford to resign, but he did ask him \"to do the right thing for himself, his family and our state.\"\n\n\n\nSanford and his staff have said repeatedly this week that he will not resign.

Around active forest fires. On the sides of mountains. You can't even bitch at these guys for having cushy government pensions to fall back on when they get older, because they're all private-sector contractors. Which means if they aren't out fighting forest fires or doing preventative forestry on unburned woods (basically extreme landscaping), they are losing money. They are the hardest working men in the tree business.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouthern Oregon in the summer is a tinderbox. Last year the state recorded some 560 wild fires, the majority of which occurred in the seemingly endless sea of trees running across its bottom from the Cascades to the Pacific Coast. Humidity is next to nonexistent, which is extremely pleasant, but means that even an errant spark from a chainsaw or the proverbial cigarette butt out the car window can set the entire region ablaze.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlying into the Rogue Valley, there is evidence of past wild fires is everywhere: From the miles-long scar of the 2002 \"Biscuit\" fire stretching past the horizon, to the smaller pockets of charred trees crowding the edge of towns to the blue Wilderness-Firefighter-ribbon bumper stickers flying past on the I-5 to the elaborate wildfire and firefighter shrines at a local bar.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more of Oregon Fire Lines at VBS.TV\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are very few places firemen aren't revered as local heroes, but the wilderness firefighters of Oregon go past people simply risking their lives to help others into a crazy superhero realm where their work regularly prevents entire settlements from being destroyed. They're literally the guardians of their communities. Incidentally, their work is also very beneficial for the forest.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe spent a few days following a crew of Grayback forest-firefighters walk up the sides of what most people would consider a cliff, to chop down underbrush in preparation for a controlled burn. This is what they like to call \"project work\" -- the light stuff they do between fires. The work is the hardest and least rewarding work we have ever tried to do. Unless you consider 12-hour-plus shifts of backbreaking labor, virtually zero outside recognition, and occasional accusations of being shills for the timber industry rewards.

After graduate school, it continued.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEvans said he was unaware of the toll the additional weight was taking on his body.

Then the other. Evans, a program specialist at Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth, Texas, waited in anticipation as the number beneath him rose higher. And higher. And higher.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was 315 pounds -- a weight Evans had never dreamed of reaching, but he was forced to accept the indisputable reality that flashed before him.

Tell us about your ''Aha!'' moment on iReport\n\n\n\n\n\nHow he did it: Evans purchased a treadmill to ensure he had access to workout equipment at all times without limiting himself to going to the gym or facing days of bad weather. He started doing cardio for 45 minutes, five days a week. The treadmill came with an eight-week plan for low-calorie meals that he could prepare.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe stayed focused on the program by keeping the price of the treadmill in mind: $1,200. \"I would focus on how much I paid for the treadmill and for that not to be wasted,\" he said. \"I was giving myself one chance to prove myself to myself.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBiggest obstacle: Evans said his biggest obstacle was managing his time. When he changed his diet, he included several items that he didn't usually eat, and working them into his daily routine initially was a challenge. He decided to sit down on Sundays and plan his workouts and meals for the week, including when he would prepare food.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintaining diet: While dieting, Evan aimed to eat 1,800 calories a day. Now Evans eats five meals a day, with calorie counts totaling 2,500. Some of the items on his regimen include protein shakes, eggs, turkey, almonds, baked chicken breast and steamed veggies.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintaining workouts: Evans does 20 minutes of cardio five days a week. He runs intervals for 10 minutes and then does 10 minutes of another aerobic activity such as the StairMaster or a rowing machine.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes of success: His mother said she has seen a distinct change in him, and she said she is proud of her youngest son's accomplishments. \"I think he takes more pride in himself,\" she said. \"I'm proud that Kevin is taking charge of his health.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal thoughts: \"You can't just go on a diet for a few months and lose weight and then go back to exactly how you were living before and expect everything to be the same,\" Evans said. \"Ironically, it seems like the older I get, the better I get.

Shakespeare died in 1616.\n\nThe Cobbe portrait -- named after the Irish family that owns the painting -- shows Shakespeare with rosy cheeks, a full head of hair, and a reddish brown beard.\n\nThe most common portrait of Shakespeare is a gray image showing a bald Bard with a small mustache and beard, and bags under his eyes.\n\nThe identity of the man in the portrait was lost over the centuries -- until Alec Cobbe saw a portrait from Washington's Folger Shakespeare Library. That painting, which fell into disfavor as a Shakespeare portrait about 70 years ago, turned out to be one of four copies of Cobbe's portrait.\n\nThe portrait \"shows a man wearing expensive costuming, including a very beautifully painted ruff of Italian lacework which would have been very expensive,\" Wells said.\n\n\"It establishes, for me, that Shakespeare in his later years was a rather wealthy, a rather well affluent member of aristocratic circles in the society of his time,\" Wells said.\n\n\"There's been too much of a tendency to believe that Shakespeare, being the son of a glover, coming for a small town in the middle of England, that he necessarily retained a rather humble status throughout his life.\"\n\nWells reads even more into what he sees in Shakespeare's newly-found face.\n\n\"I think it's plausible as a portrait as a good listener, of somebody who would have been capable of writing the plays, clearly the face of a man of high intelligence,\" he said.\n\n\"It's the face of a man, I think, who betrays a good deal of wisdom in his features. But, of course, as somebody (King Duncan) says in Shakespeare's story Macbeth, 'there's no art to find the mind's construction in the face.'\"\n\nIt should be noted that Shakespeare's King Duncan paid a price for judging Macbeth to have the face of an honorable man. Macbeth later murdered the king.\n\nThe public can read Shakespeare's face from the original painting at Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in Stratford-upon-Avon where it goes on display for several months starting April 23.\n\nThe portrait then returns to the Cobbe family, which inherited it when an ancestor married England's Earl of Southampton -- a friend of Shakespeare who likely commissioned its painting.", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- For a little while, it looks like \"Up,\" P", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- For a little while, it looks like \"Up,\" Pixar's 10th feature-length film, is going to be a downer.\n\n\n\nIn \"Up,\" a curmudgeonly senior citizen, Carl, tries to cope with the enthusiasm of Russell, a young boy.\n\n\n\nNot that there's anything wrong with an animated film tugging at our tear ducts. But you can sense unease rippling through the younger halves of the family audience when, about five minutes into a spunky prologue, intrepid pre-pubescents Carl and Ellie abruptly morph into newlyweds, and then not-so-newlyweds.\n\n\n\nThey gray and stoop before our eyes, youthful dreams of exploration traded in for the comforts of home and domestic bliss. Ellie wants a baby but can't have one. Their savings for the holiday of a lifetime are eaten up by this rainy day, that domestic disaster, until there's no more lifetime left -- not for Ellie, anyway.\n\n\n\nThat leaves us with Carl, a grumpy homebody voiced by Ed Asner, who makes WALL-E look like a chatterbox. And he's one of the main characters.\n\n\n\nNo, I didn't hear anyone demanding when the dancing penguins were going to show up, but I'll wager someone was thinking it.  Watch a preview of \"Up\" \u00bb\n\n\n\nSuch misgivings are ill-founded. As far as razzmatazz goes, \"Up\" delivers the goods. Not penguins, precisely, but more than the airborne house promised by the commercials.\n\n\n\nThere's a mythical multicolored bird, which may or may not be a snipe, but which answers to the name of Kevin and exhibits a sweet taste for candy bars. There are zeppelins and old-time explorers and talking dogs -- a whole pack of dogs, in fact. Dogs that serve wine and play cards and fly biplanes.\n\n\n\nAnd there's Russell, a chubby Boy Scout -- or \"Wilderness Explorer\" -- who turns up on Carl's doorstep when he least expects it. After all, Carl wants to be free, and to get there, he launches his house into the sky thanks to thousands of balloons. How was he to know Russell was around?\n\n\n\n\"Up\" doesn't always fly high. The dogs' canine high jinks are closer to \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\" than we'd expect from Pixar, which tends not to play so fast and loose with the laws of nature for the sake of a few cheap laughs.\n\n\n\nBut if the muttering mutts keep the kids happy, well and good. The movie is on surer ground teasing out the relationship between Carl and Russell, floating well above the Earth.\n\n\n\nRussell is all wide-eyed innocence and boundless enthusiasm, haplessly helpful. He's the mirror image of the child Carl used to be, if only the old man were capable of recognizing it.\n\n\n\nBut instead of looking around him, Carl is focused on landing that prize home of his in the prime location he mistakes for his ultimate destination (the lost world of Paradise Falls). The image of Carl valiantly dragging his house through jungle and over mountains will strike a chord with anyone holding down a mortgage. iReport.com: Share your review of \"Up\"\n\n\n\nWritten by Bob Petersen and directed by Petersen and Pete Docter -- both Pixar veterans -- \"Up\" mixes allegory with adventure and dumb imaginative exuberance. The balance isn't quite as tight as in Pixar's best movies, but the lightness is appealing, and Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) is an irresistible character. He's already carrying his own emotional baggage at 8 years old, but he's all heart, the kind to give kids a good name.\n\n\n\nScreening in 3-D where possible, \"Up\" doesn't go overboard on stereoscopic gimmickry, but does exploit depth of field in a string of exhilarating cliffhangers and dogfights.\n\n\n\nFunny and poignant and full of life, \"Up\" easily qualifies as one of the best movies of the year so far.

Deep in the core of Johnny there's a toughness.\"\n\n\n\nDepp gained recognition throughout the 1990s for immersing himself in characters.

But the oceans, like the land, have gotten crowded, and now scientists and policy makers are looking for ways to plan ocean development -- with the aim of preventing our public-owned seas from turning into sprawling, watery versions of Houston, Texas, or Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n\n\n\"The oceans are kind of the last frontier for use and development,\" said Amanda Leland, ocean policy director at the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group. \"Even in the 1970s we thought that the oceans were limitless resources of fish. We know today now that fisheries are collapsing all around the world.\"\n\n\n\nIn an attempt to address this and other crowding problems, governments are for the first time devising comprehensive plans for their marine waters.\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration on June 12 announced a task force devoted to federal ocean planning. By September, the group must recommend a national policy on the subject that's designed to protect ocean ecology, address climate change and promote sustainable ocean economies.\n\n\n\nA handful of states, including Massachusetts and Rhode Island, are charting similar courses. Massachusetts on June 30 published a draft plan for its coastal waters, which is scheduled to be finalized by the end of the year. One of the state's main aims is to make space for two ocean wind farms -- taking up 2 percent of the state's waters -- without angering fishing industries, killing whales or harming ecosystems.\n\n\n\nInternationally, several European countries, including Denmark, Belgium, the United Kingdom and France, are pioneering the new field, said Fanny Douvere, a co-principal investigator at UNESCO's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.\n\n\n\nOcean advocates say these planning processes are urgently needed and have been a long time in coming.\n\n\n\nOne reason it's taken so long is that people can't see that the oceans are filling up, said Sandra Whitehouse, a marine biologist and senior adviser at the Ocean Conservancy, an environmental group.\n\n\n\n\"The majority of the ecosystem is under the water,\" Whitehouse said. \"So it's out of sight, out of mind. We're only looking at the surface.\"\n\n\n\nBeneath the water, though, overfishing has caused some fish stocks to collapse. By one report, wild fish could disappear by mid-century.\n\n\n\nThe energy sector threatens to take up large chunks of water. Shipping lanes cross the paths of endangered whales. Fish farms are growing in some countries. Climate change is altering ocean chemistry. And power lines, reefs, lobster traps and sunken ships compete for seafloor space.\n\n\n\nIn Europe's North Sea, expanding industries have tried to claim three times the amount of ocean space than is available, said Douvere, of UNESCO.\n\n\n\nWhat happens on land also affects the oceans. A 2003 report by the Pew Oceans Commission says that each year, coastal development destroys 20,000 acres of estuaries and near-coast fish habitat.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, pavement on land creates \"expressways\" for oil and other pollutants to run into the ocean. \"Every eight months, nearly 11 million gallons of oil run off our streets and driveways into our waters -- the equivalent of the Exxon Valdez oil spill,\" the report says.\n\n\n\nWhen the renewable energy sector started trying to move into the sea, the situation went from crowded to unmanageable and without a clear plan, said Whitehouse, of the Ocean Conservancy.\n\n\n\n\"There's a lot of pressure to be able to harness this energy,\" she said, \"but it's very important that this be done in a proactive and comprehensive way, because we also have so many important economic aspects of our oceans.\"\n\n\n\nSince there are new uses but not new space, planning is necessary, said Charles Ehler, another co-principal investigator at the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.

This was the first time a U.S. president visited Turkey at the start of his term, sending a clear signal that this administration recognizes the importance of Turkey and wants to engage with it from the start.\n\n\n\nHis address in the Turkish parliament was one of the greatest speeches made by an American leader in such a setting: He not only showed his deep understanding of Turkey's many complex issues and identities, but also handled tough issues with great skill. He framed his talk just right by underlining Turkey's European identity as a secular democracy.\n\n\n\nThat said, it is important to remember how good U.S.-Turkey relations were at the start of the Bush administration. President George W. Bush also considered Turkey an extremely valuable partner, but then came the Iraq war. The United States genuinely believed Turkey would be one of the most important allies going forward.\n\n\n\nDespite official channels and experts making clear the difficulties in allowing U.S. military to cross into Iraq via its lands, the administration chose to listen to those who sang music to its ears. As a result, they based a whole military strategy on the Turkish parliament voting yes and were shocked when they received a no. Bilateral relations then entered a downward spiral.\n\n\n\nWith Obama's election, there is renewed excitement in Turkey. Like most of the people of Turkey, he opposed the Iraq war and considered Afghanistan the \"good war.\" Going forward, as President Obama underscored in his speech, Turkey can play an important role in Afghanistan as a reliable NATO ally. The question is: How can Turkey best help?\n\n\n\nTurkey is one of the few -- possibly the only -- NATO member that has deep religious, cultural and historic knowledge of both Afghanistan and Pakistan. In fact, the Turkish government has brought together the presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan much before the United States began approaching them together.\n\n\n\nReading the tea leaves, one may conclude that the Obama administration wants to cooperate with Turkey in engaging with the Taliban in Pakistan and Afghanistan. This would be the wrong kind of cooperation. Although Turkey has channels to the Taliban and has means to facilitate the talks, there cannot be a morally acceptable deal reached with the Taliban, whose ultimate goal is to curb all individual freedoms and universal human rights, especially when it comes to women.\n\n\n\nNo matter what the reasonable sounding arguments may be in favor of this strategy, pulling Turkey into any kind of engagement with the Taliban -- either as part of NATO or bilaterally -- would have much worse long-term consequences.\n\n\n\nInstead, the Obama administration needs to think of \"victory\" not only in the short term and from a purely anti-terrorism perspective, but also in consideration of the people who have lived and will continue to live in those lands. In other words, providing true safety, security, justice and development for Afghanistan and Pakistan -- not the kind of society the Taliban has been providing.\n\n\n\nIndeed, it is in providing the basic securities that Turkey can be a great partner. Turkey not only can and will continue to help provide safety and physical security, but also could further assist with the reconstruction projects, such as building hospitals, schools, sanitation facilities and investment projects that would have direct impact on the socioeconomic development of the Afghan and Pakistani societies.\n\n\n\nThere are many Turkish companies that have undertaken successful construction projects in these fields since early 2002. There are also military and civilian trainers, nongovernment organizations and even volunteer teachers who work in some of the most dangerous regions.\n\n\n\nStill, Turkey can possibly make the greatest contribution by helping the United States frame the challenges ", "qas": []}]}, {"title": "Kansas City, Missouri (CNN) -- Deborah Bradley app", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Kansas City, Missouri (CNN) -- Deborah Bradley appeared calm and joyful just hours before her baby daughter was reported missing, according to a supermarket clerk who sold her baby wipes, baby food and boxed wine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She had a smile on her face, like she always does when she comes in here,\" said clerk Rebecca Guerrero, whom FBI agents interviewed Saturday about conversations she'd had with Bradley.\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance video recorded at a grocery store on October 3 shows Bradley and a man purchasing the items from Guerrero the day before 11-month-old Lisa Irwin was reported missing.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice, who were joined in their search effort by federal authorities last week, have said they have no suspects or solid leads in Lisa's disappearance.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN, Guerrero described the FBI agents' questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They pretty much asked me if she was depressed, ... how she acted around the baby, if she seemed stressed out,\" Guerrero said. \"I told them she never looked depressed around me.

He also left behind suicide notes with vague references to the Calvert case, said Beaufort County Sheriff P.J.
