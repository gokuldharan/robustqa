000dcb29a39a4d63855ad20d5ca16589,"The film begins when Alice Melbourne and Judson Ellis arrive by taxi at a municipal airport in California. From the cabin they send the driver generously and bribe him not to tell anyone about them. Alice and Judson look at the departure sign for The Silver Queen, on their way to Panama City, Panama, and look excited and anxious. Peggy Nolan is also waiting for the same flight for whom a delivery of expensive flowers is made with a ticket thanking her for the favor. Peggy contemptuously throws the card in the trash and gives the flowers to a woman who sells cheap gardeners. Shortly afterwards, the flight prepares to depart and we are introduced to Professor and Mrs Spengler, an elderly couple, and Joe, the flight's co-pilot, who is immediately attracted to Alice. Mrs. Spengler is a dominant woman, but her husband seems content to master like a child. While waiting on the tarmac near the plane, a car drives by and a well-dressed man appears with a young boy and another man. The boy is Tommy and he is sent away with 'uncle' Pete until his father - a master - can follow later. While the passengers are on board, Bill, the pilot, receives the message that they will return an anarchist to Panama, but he assures the group that there is nothing to worry about as the man will be in custody during the flight. be. The prisoner is Vasquez and is accompanied by a treasure hunter named Crimp. After Larry, the steward, helps settle everyone down, the flight departs with his twelve souls on board. Bill and Joe discuss plans for the postponement and Joe indicates that he has an interest in Alice. He goes back to the passenger compartment where beds have been made and people turn in for the night - except for Crimp who plans to stay up and make sure Vasquez does not 'go for a walk' - and cheats the hangman and himself out of $ 5,000. Peter catch up on his young costs for the night and help him say his prayers (something Pete does not know). Peggy comes to the cabin to visit Bill, whose rudeness finally makes it clear that he wants nothing to do with her. When Alice calls the steward, Joe takes the call and makes a play for her. The next morning the plane arrives for a gas stop in Mexico and the passengers have breakfast. Joe continues to chase Alice, assuming she's Judson's secretary. Peggy"

0cf2e31a80c244fdb279688a6f7ee219,"New Orleans, Louisiana, 1927. A group of enraged men descend on the isolated Seven Doors Hotel at the bottom of the swamp. They catch an artist called Schweik (Antoine Saint John), who is cloistered there. Accusing him of being a sorcerer, Schweik is dragged into the cellar where he is savagely beaten with heavy chains, tortured with quicklime acid and crucified with his wrists nailed to a cellar wall, despite his terrible warnings of unleashing evil. New Orleans, 1981. Liza Merril (Catriona MacColl) is a young woman who arrives from New York to claim the hotel as her heirloom. Barely the architect friend Marin Avery (Michele Mirabella) begins to show him around the property, strange incidents begin to occur. A painter (Anthony Flees) falls off his platform and is horribly injured, coughing up blood and babbling ""eyes, eyes"". Dr John McCabe (David Warbeck) arrives to take the injured man to the hospital and offers Liza his sympathy. Next, a plumber, named Joe, tries to fix a major leak in the flooded cellar. However, he is assassinated by a presence that has emerged from behind a thin wall. The hotel's atmosphere is further cooled by the creepy servants, Arthur (Giampaolo Saccarola) and Martha (Veronica Lazar), who apparently come with the hotel. Martha discovers Joe's corpse in the basement and another much older corpse lying in a nearby pool of dirty water. It is apparently that of Schweik, the artist. Walking down the 14 mile causeway to New Orleans, Liza meets a strange blind woman standing in the middle of the desolate road. The blind woman introduces herself as Emily (Sarah Keller) and tells Liza that she was waiting for her, although her eyes are blocked with cataracts. Liza drives Emily to her richly furnished house in New Orleans. Liza is warned by Emily to leave the hotel while she can. Meanwhile in the hospital morgue, Dr. John McCabe performs the autopsy of Joe the Plumber while his assistant Harris (Al Cliver) wants to install an EMG machine on Schweik's corpse. John laughs and leaves for lunch, while Harris stays behind to set up the EMG machine. After Harris leaves on a call, the EMG machine begins to vibrate with activity. A little later, Joe's wife, Mary-Anne"

With war threatening to tear the country apart, a stone and anvil appeared from the sky in the city of London, with a sword firmly planted in the anvil. Read the words on the stab of the sword: ""Whoever draws this sword from this stone, and the anvil is rightly king, born of England."" Many try to draw the sword, but no one can bounce it. In time, the sword is forgotten, and the dark ages plunge the countryside into a gloomy state. One day in the woods, Sir Kaye is out hunting with his adopted brother Arthur, whom everyone calls 'wart'. After missing Kaye for shooting a deer, Arthur promises to fetch the arrow. Arthur's journey leads him to a small hut in which a wizard named Merlin and his pet owl, Archimedes, live who can speak. Merlin explains to Arthur that he expected him to appear. After drinking tea, Merlin decides to accompany Arthur back to his house, and after packing everything in the hut in a small suitcase, the two leave. Arthur"

Because he believes that Brink is an ordinary stranger, the old Gramps commands Mr. Brink the property. Pud comes out of the house and asks who the stranger was. Gramps was amazed and relieved that someone else could see the stranger; he was not merely a dream or appearance. Pud tells Gramps that when he does a good deed, he will be able to make a wish. Because his apples are constantly being stolen, Gramps wishes that anyone who climbs his apple tree should stay there until he allows them to climb down. Pud accidentally tests the wish if he struggles to get off the tree himself, and only becomes free when Gramps says he can. Pud's busy aunt Demetria (Eily Malyon) has designs on Pud and the money his parents left behind. Gramps spends a lot of time fending off her attempts to adopt the boy. Brink takes Grandma Nellie (Beulah Bondi) to a peaceful death just after completing some knitting. When Mr. Brink returning to Gramps"

If we do not reduce each individual's demand for water (both directly and through incorporated water), the water situation will become dire. It is obvious that we cannot increase the demand for water much more without damaging effects on the environment, society and the economy. It is very easy to blame someone else for the water situation - ""if 70% of the water is used for agriculture, then that is what we should aim for"" - but it is not that easy. We all depend on the food and resources that agriculture provides, and while there are definitely opportunities to increase water efficiency on the farm, the solution will require more than that. We all share the responsibility for the sustainable management of our water resources, which means using less water at home, in the workplace, at school, on vacation, on the farm, ... everyone, everywhere, at all times. Time to save water! This means re-evaluating our relationship with water and learning to use it more sparingly. At the most basic level, it requires a change in behavior and assigning a value to water that truly reflects its value"

418d5d03316c4504882afb7e275d3d8b,"In ancient times, England was in turmoil. With the death of the King, no one can decide who is the rightful heir to the throne. With war threatening to tear the country apart, a stone and anvil appeared from the sky in the city of London, with a sword firmly planted in the anvil. Read the words on the stab of the sword: ""Whoever draws this sword from this stone, and the anvil is rightly king, born of England."" Many try to draw the sword, but no one can bounce it. In time, the sword is forgotten, and the dark ages plunge the countryside into a gloomy state. One day in the woods, Sir Kaye is out hunting with his adopted brother Arthur, whom everyone calls 'wart'. After missing Kaye for shooting a deer, Arthur promises to fetch the arrow. Arthur's journey leads him to a small hut in which a wizard named Merlin and his pet owl, Archimedes, live who can speak. Merlin explains to Arthur that he expected him to appear. After drinking tea, Merlin decides to accompany Arthur back to his house, and after packing everything in the hut in a small suitcase, the two leave. Arthur and Merlin arrive at Sir Ector's castle, where Arthur is immediately put to work in the kitchen. Merlin introduces himself to Ector, and shows his powers to the doubting Knight. After some persuasion, Ector allows Merlin to stay and puts him in the Northwest Tower, a crumbling building of the castle. A few days later Archimedes notices the arrival of Sir Pelinore, who brought news from London of a tournament to Ector and Kaye. According to the rules, the winner of the tournament becomes the new king of England. Ector starts eagerly getting Kaye to practice, promising in his excitement for Arthur that if he keeps working hard on his duties, he can become Kaye's penguin. Merlin hears of this news and decides to push Arthur to see his true potential (since Merlin can move into the past and the future, he knows who Arthur is going to become). As he walks outside next to the castle moat, Merlin explains that he can turn into a fish. This idea excites Arthur, and Merline turns them both into fish to explore the moat. However, a much larger fish soon gives way to the young Arthur, until they both manage to escape. Arthur's inertia in helping Kaye practice leads to him washing dishes. Merlin"

47900b3335964781898116ccead5861a,"New Orleans, Louisiana, 1927. A group of enraged men descend on the isolated Seven Doors Hotel deep in the swamps. They grab an artist named Schweik (Antoine Saint John), who is cloistered there. Accusing him of being a witch, Schweik is dragged into the basement where he is savagely beaten with heavy chains, tortured with quicklime acid, and crucified with his wrists nailed to the cellar wall, despite his dire warnings that he will be unleashed. evil. New Orleans, 1981. Liza Merril (Catriona MacColl) is a young woman who comes from New York City to claim the hotel as her inheritance. As soon as architect friend Marin Avery (Michele Mirabella) starts showing her around the property, strange incidents start to happen. A painter (Anthony Flees) falls off his platform and is horribly injured, coughing up blood and babbling about ""the eyes, the eyes."" Dr. John McCabe (David Warbeck) arrives to take the injured man to the hospital and offers Liza some sympathy. Next, a plumber named Joe tries to repair a major leak in the flooded basement. However, he is killed by a presence that emerged from behind a thin-walled wall. The atmosphere in the hotel is further cooled by the creepy-looking servants, Arthur (Giampaolo Saccarola) and Martha (Veronica Lazar), who apparently come with the hotel. Martha discovers Joe's corpse in the basement and another much older corpse lying in a pool of dirty water nearby. Apparently it's that of Schweik, the artist. Driving down the 14-mile driveway toward New Orleans, Liza meets a strange blind woman, standing in the middle of the desolate highway. The blind woman introduces herself as Emily (Sarah Keller) and tells Liza that she has been waiting for her, even though her eyes are occluded by cataracts. Liza takes Emily to her luxuriously furnished home in New Orleans. Emily warns Liza to leave the hotel while she can. Meanwhile, at the hospital morgue, Dr. John McCabe performs an autopsy on Joe the plumber, while his assistant Harris (Al Cliver) wants to install an EMG machine on Schweik's corpse. John laughs and goes to lunch, while Harris stays to install the EMG machine. After Harris leaves for a call, the EMG machine begins to throb with activity. A little later, Joe's wife, Mary-Anne (Laura De Marchi), arrives with her daughter Jill (Maria Pia Marsale) to dress her husband's corpse for the funeral, when she is murdered in a horrific acid-scalded manner. . Jill is then threatened by Schweik's reanimated corpse. Liza meets with John McCabe in a downtown bar to discuss her misgivings and anxieties. He expresses perplexity when Lisa complains about the ineptitude of her strange servants. John claims that he had never heard of them before despite knowing everyone in the area. Then comes a phone call from Harris's bar informing John that Mary-Anne's body was found in the morgue, while Jill was found huddled in a corner scared and unable to speak. After Joe and Mary-Anne's funeral, Emily appears to Liza again that night at the hotel. Emily tells Liza about the witch Schweik, who stayed in room 36 of the hotel, and about the supernatural underworld that the hotel hides. The hotel was built on one of the Seven Gates of Hell and Schweik has been the Guardian. Emily"

From the cabin they send the driver generously and bribe him not to tell anyone about them. Alice and Judson look at the departure sign for The Silver Queen, on their way to Panama City, Panama, and look excited and anxious. Peggy Nolan is also waiting for the same flight for whom a delivery of expensive flowers is made with a ticket thanking her for the favor. Peggy contemptuously throws the card in the trash and gives the flowers to a woman who sells cheap gardeners. Shortly afterwards, the flight prepares to depart and we are introduced to Professor and Mrs Spengler, an elderly couple, and Joe, the flight's co-pilot, who is immediately attracted to Alice. Mrs. Spengler is a dominant woman, but her husband seems content to master like a child. While waiting on the tarmac near the plane, a car drives by and a well-dressed man appears with a young boy and another man. The boy is Tommy and he is sent away with 'uncle' Pete until his father - a master - can follow later. While the passengers are on board, Bill, the pilot, receives the message that they will return an anarchist to Panama"

5b25d50f66f44eefb9008faaf8e344c6,"A lonely old woman longing for a child is given a seed by a good witch. When planted, the seed grows into a flower and inside the flower is a little girl as big as the old woman's thumb. The old woman calls the girl Thumbelina and raises her as her own. Although Thumbelina loves her mother, she longs for company of someone of her own size. One evening Cornelius, the fairytale prince, comes upon Thumbelina after hearing her beautiful song. The two ride on Cornelius' bumblebee and fall in love; During this ride, Mrs. Toad and her son Grundel are enchanted by the singing of Thumbelina. Cornelius promises to return the next day, but after he leaves, Mrs. Toumbelina kidnaps her from her bed and takes her away. Thumbelina wakes up on Mrs. Toad's display boat. Mrs Toad wants Thumbelina to join their group and marry Grundel, who is in love with her. They leave Thumbelina alone on a lily pad to fetch a priest, but a friendly swallow, Jacquimo (the narrator of the film), hears Thumbelina's cries for help and frees her. Jacquimo's friends, the jitterbugs, promise to help Thumbelina get home safely while Jacquimo leaves to track down Cornelius. Meanwhile, Cornelius learns of Thumbelina's abduction and dares to find her. While trying to get home, Thumbelina is led into a trap by Berkeley Beetle, who scares away the jitter bugs. He is delighted with her singing and promises to show her the way home once she sings on his Beetle Ball. Thumbelina agrees, but if she is badly received at the Beetle Ball, Beetle kicks her out without helping her. Winter is approaching. Jacquimo accidentally drops his wing on a thorn and is knocked out by the cold, while Cornelius falls into a lake and is frozen in ice. Grundel, who is looking for Thumbelina, finds Beetle and discovers that she is in love with Prince Cornelius and decides to find and kidnap Cornelius to lure Thumbelina to him. Grundel forces Beetle to help him because Grundel steals his wings and will not return them until Beetle has found and captured Cornelius. Thumbelina is picked up by Miss Fieldmouse, who tells her that Cornelius is deceased. The two visit Miss Fieldmouse's neighbor, Mr. Mole, which tells them about a dead bird he found in his tunnel earlier in the day. It turns out to be Jacquimo, who discovers Thumbelina that he is just unconscious. Mr. Mole wants to marry Thumbelina; sad about Cornelius' death, Thumbelina accepts. Jacquimo wakes up under Thumbelina's care and leaves to find Cornelius, refusing to believe he's dead. Meanwhile, Beetle brings Cornelius' frozen body to Grundel and informs him that Thumbelina is going to marry the Mole. After the two leave to stop the wedding, the young jitterbugs thaw Cornelius' body. At the wedding, Thumbelina realizes at the last minute that she cannot marry someone she does not love and refuses to take the vows. Grundel and Beetle crashed the wedding, but Thumbelina fled for them and Mr. Mole. Cornelius intercepts the crowd and confronts Grundel, the ensuing battle that leads to them both falling into an abyss. After being outside and free, Thumbelina is reunited with Jacquimo, who takes her to Cornelius' kingdom, the Vale of the Fairies"

61dbf1d37448474d892eeab4dfdcf6b7,"In ancient times, England was in turmoil. With the death of the king, no one can decide who is the rightful heir to the throne. As war threatens to tear the country apart, a stone and an anvil appear from the sky over the city of London, with a sword firmly planted in the anvil. On the hilt of the sword read the words: ""Whoever draws this sword from this stone and from this anvil is a sane king, born of England."" Many try to draw the sword, but none can move it. In time, the sword is forgotten, and the Dark Ages plunge the countryside into dire straits. One day, in the woods, Sir Kaye goes hunting with his adopted brother Arthur, whom everyone calls ""wart"". After preventing Kaye from shooting a deer, Arthur promises to get the arrow back. Arthur's journey leads him to a small hut, where a wizard named Merlin resides and his pet owl, Archimedes, who can talk. Merlin explains to Arthur that he expected him to appear. After having tea, Merlin decides to accompany Arthur home, and after packing everything in the hut in a small satchel, the two leave. Arthur and Merlin arrive at Sir Ector's castle, where Arthur is immediately put to work in the kitchen. Merlin introduces himself to Ector and shows his powers to the doubting knight. After some persuasion, Ector allows Merlin to stay, placing him in the Northwest Tower, a ruined building in the castle. A few days later, Archimedes observes the arrival of Sir Pelinore, who has brought news from London of a jousting tournament to Ector and Kaye. According to the rules, the winner of the tournament will become the new King of England. Ector eagerly begins to train Kaye, and in his excitement, promises Arthur that if he continues to work hard at his homework, he can become Kaye's squire. Merlin hears about this news and decides to push Arthur to see his true potential (as Merlin can move into the past and the future, he knows who Arthur will become). While walking outside along the castle moat, Merlin explains that he can turn into a fish. This idea turns Arthur on, and Merline turns them both into fish, to explore the moat. However, a much larger fish soon gives chase to young Arthur, until they both manage to escape. Arthur's delay in helping Kaye train causes him to wash the dishes. Merlin"

The finding should eliminate fears that such laws may have the opposite effect because they may lead people to smoke more at home. Several countries, such as Japan and Australia, have tightened laws on smoking in public places in recent years. Meanwhile, some countries, such as the Netherlands and Germany, still allow smoking in pubs and restaurants. Only about half of the states in the US have full bans, and there are few restrictions in the poorest nations. Opponents often claim that bans could make people smoke more at home, which would be worse for their children's health. Asthma is a major concern, as secondhand smoke damages children's airways in a number of ways. Researchers led by Jasper Been at Maastricht University Medical Center reviewed up to 11 studies that examined how hospital admissions for childhood asthma and preterm births changed after the smoking ban went into effect. The studies involved more than 2.5 million births and nearly 250,000 hospital admissions for asthma. The result shows that both asthma admissions and preterm birth rates"

With war threatening to tear the country apart, a stone and anvil appeared from the sky in the city of London, with a sword firmly planted in the anvil. Read the words on the stab of the sword: ""Whoever draws this sword from this stone, and the anvil is rightly king, born of England."" Many try to draw the sword, but no one can bounce it. In time, the sword is forgotten, and the dark ages plunge the countryside into a gloomy state. One day in the woods, Sir Kaye is out hunting with his adopted brother Arthur, whom everyone calls 'wart'. After missing Kaye for shooting a deer, Arthur promises to fetch the arrow. Arthur's journey leads him to a small hut in which a wizard named Merlin and his pet owl, Archimedes, live who can speak. Merlin explains to Arthur that he expected him to appear. After drinking tea, Merlin decides to accompany Arthur back to his house, and after packing everything in the hut in a small suitcase, the two leave. Arthur and Merlin"

959d8f2367e04006bf34c5f1e6b85391,"New Orleans, Louisiana, 1927. A group of enraged men descend on the isolated Seven Doors Hotel at the bottom of the swamp. They catch an artist called Schweik (Antoine Saint John), who is cloistered there. Accusing him of being a sorcerer, Schweik is dragged into the cellar where he is savagely beaten with heavy chains, tortured with quicklime acid and crucified with his wrists nailed to a cellar wall, despite his terrible warnings of unleashing evil. New Orleans, 1981. Liza Merril (Catriona MacColl) is a young woman who arrives from New York to claim the hotel as her heirloom. Barely the architect friend Marin Avery (Michele Mirabella) begins to show him around the property, strange incidents begin to occur. A painter (Anthony Flees) falls off his platform and is horribly injured, coughing up blood and babbling ""eyes, eyes"". Dr John McCabe (David Warbeck) arrives to take the injured man to the hospital and offers Liza his sympathy. Next, a plumber, named Joe, tries to fix a major leak in the flooded cellar. However, he is assassinated by a presence that has emerged from behind a thin wall. The hotel's atmosphere is further cooled by the creepy servants, Arthur (Giampaolo Saccarola) and Martha (Veronica Lazar), who apparently come with the hotel. Martha discovers Joe's corpse in the basement and another much older corpse lying in a nearby pool of dirty water. It is apparently that of Schweik, the artist. Walking down the 14 mile causeway to New Orleans, Liza meets a strange blind woman standing in the middle of the desolate road. The blind woman introduces herself as Emily (Sarah Keller) and tells Liza that she was waiting for her, although her eyes are blocked with cataracts. Liza drives Emily to her richly furnished house in New Orleans. Liza is warned by Emily to leave the hotel while she can. Meanwhile in the hospital morgue, Dr. John McCabe performs the autopsy of Joe the Plumber while his assistant Harris (Al Cliver) wants to install an EMG machine on Schweik's corpse. John laughs and leaves for lunch, while Harris stays behind to set up the EMG machine. After Harris leaves on a call, the EMG machine begins to vibrate with activity. A little later, Joe's wife, Mary-Anne"

96ae0492dbe9483caadadddb9b6b8453,"A lonely old woman who longs for a child receives a seed from a good witch. Once planted, the seed turns into a flower and inside the flower is a little girl the size of the old woman's thumb. The old woman names the daughter Thumbelina and brings her up as her own. Although Thumbelina loves her mother, she longs for the company of someone her size. One night, Cornelius, the prince of the fairies, stumbles upon Thumbelina after hearing her beautiful song. The two take a ride on Cornelius' drone and fall in love; during this walk, Mrs. Toad and her son Grundel are enchanted by the song of Thumbelina. Cornelius promises to return the next day, but after he leaves, Mrs. Toad kidnaps Thumbelina from her bed and takes her away. Thumbelina wakes up on Ms. Toad's demonstration boat. Ms. Toad wants Thumbelina to join their troop and marry Grundel, who is in love with her. They leave Thumbelina alone on a water lily to fetch a priest, but a friendly swallow, Jacquimo (the film's narrator), overhears Thumbelina's calls for help and frees her. Jacquimo's friends, the jitterbugs, promise to help Thumbelina get home safely while Jacquimo goes in search of Cornelius. Meanwhile, Cornelius learns of Thumbelina's kidnapping and ventures to find her. While trying to get home, Thumbelina is ambushed by Berkeley Beetle, who scares off the jitterbugs. He is in love with her singing and promises to show her the way home if she sings to his Beetle Ball first. Thumbelina agrees, but when she is badly received at the Beetle Ball, Beetle kicks her out without helping her. Winter is coming. Jacquimo accidentally impales his wing on a thorn and is knocked out by the cold, while Cornelius falls into a lake and is frozen in ice. Grundel, who is looking for Thumbelina, finds Beetle and finds out that she is in love with Prince Cornelius and upon some convincing Beetle, decides to find and kidnap Cornelius to lure Thumbelina towards him. Grundel forces Beetle to help him as Grundel steals his wings and won't return them until Beetle finds and captures Cornelius. Thumbelina is taken in by Miss Fieldmouse, who tells her that Cornelius is deceased. The two visit Miss Fieldmouse's neighbor, Mr. Mole, who tells them about a dead bird he found in his tunnel earlier today. It turns out to be Jacquimo, whom Thumbelina discovers to be only unconscious. Mr. Mole wishes to marry Thumbelina; heartbroken by Cornelius' death, Thumbelina accepts. Jacquimo wakes up in Thumbelina's care and goes in search of Cornelius, refusing to believe he is dead. Meanwhile, Beetle brings Cornelius' frozen body to Grundel and informs him that Thumbelina is going to marry the mole. After the two leave to end the marriage, the young jitterbugs thaw Cornelius' body. At the wedding, Thumbelina realizes at the last moment that she cannot marry someone she does not like and refuses to take the vows. Grundel and Beetle crush the marriage, but Thumbelina runs away from them and Mr. Mole. Cornelius intercepts the crowd and confronts Grundel, the ensuing fight drops them both into an abyss. Once outside and free, Thumbelina finds Jacquimo"

With war threatening to tear the country apart, a stone and anvil appear from the sky in the city of London, with a sword firmly embedded in the anvil. On the hilt of the sword, read the words: ""Whoever takes this sword from this stone and anvil, is king, born in England."" Many try to draw the sword, but no one can move it. In time, the sword is forgotten and the Middle Ages plunged the countryside into a gloomy state. One day, in the woods, Sir Kaye goes hunting with his adopted brother Arthur, whom everyone calls 'Wart'. After making Kaye not shoot a deer, Arthur promises to get the arrow back. Arthur's journey leads him to a small cabin, in which a wizard named Merlin resides and his owl, Archimedes, who can speak. Merlin explains to Arthur that he expected him to show up. After having tea, Merlin decides to accompany Arthur back to his house, and after packing everything at the cabin in a small satchel, the two set out. Arthur and Merlin arrive at Sir Ector's castle, where Arthur immediately goes to work in the kitchen. Merlin introduces himself to Ector and shows his powers to the dubious Knight. After some persuasion, Ector allows Merlin to stay, placing him in the Northwest Tower, a ruined castle building. A few days later, Archimedes observes the arrival of Sir Pelinore, who has brought news from London about a jousting tournament to Ector and Kaye. According to the rules, the winner of the tournament will become the new King of England. Ector eagerly begins to get Kaye to train, and in his enthusiasm, he promises Arthur that if he keeps working hard at his duties, he can become Kaye's squire. Merlin learns of this news and decides to pressure Arthur to see his true potential (since Merlin can move into the past and the future, he knows who Arthur will become). As he walks through the castle moat, Merlin explains that he can turn into a fish. This idea excites Arthur, and Merline turns them both into fish to explore the moat. However, a much larger fish soon pursues young Arthur, until they both manage to escape. Arthur's delay in helping Kaye practice causes him to wash the dishes. Merlin"

ab9705ed9c174e1984d4590cda74a649,"New Orleans, Louisiana, 1927. An angry post of men descends on the isolated Seven Doors Hotel deep in the swamps. They grab onto an artist named Schweik (Antoine Saint John), who is trapped there. Accusing him of being a warrior, Schweik is dragged to the basement where he is brutally beaten with heavy chains, tortured with quick lime acid, and crucified with his wrists nailed to a basement wall, despite his stern warnings that evil is unleashed. New Orleans, 1981. Liza Merril (Catriona MacColl) is a young woman who arrives from New York City to claim the hotel as her heritage. Architect friend Marin Avery (Michele Mirabella) started showing her in the area earlier, strange incidents started happening. A painter (Anthony Flees) falls off his rig and is terribly injured, he coughs up blood and chats about 'the eyes, the eyes'. Dr. John McCabe (David Warbeck) arrives to take the injured man to the hospital and offers Liza sympathy. Next, a plumber named Joe tries to repair a large leak in the flooded basement. However, he is killed by a presence that appeared behind a slender wall. The atmosphere at the hotel is further cooled by the whimsical servants, Arthur (Giampaolo Saccarola) and Martha (Veronica Lazar), who apparently come with the hotel. Martha discovers Joe's body in the basement, and another much older corpse lying in a pool of dirty water nearby. It's apparently that of Schweik, the artist. Liza drives down the 14-mile highway to New Orleans and meets a strange blind woman standing in the middle of the deserted highway. The blind woman introduces herself as Emily (Sarah Keller) and tells Liza that she has been waiting for her, even though her eyes are closed with cataracts. Liza drives Emily to her lavishly furnished home in New Orleans. Liza is warned by Emily to leave the hotel while she can still. Meanwhile, Dr John McCabe performs the autopsy on the hospital's plumber, while his assistant Harris (Al Cliver) wants to install an EMG machine in Schweik's body. John laughs it off and leaves for lunch, while Harris stays behind to install the EMG machine. After Harris leaves for a call, the EMG machine starts pulse of activity. A while later, Joe's wife Mary-Anne"

He proposes; she accepts (""only to get as far away from [her] mother as possible""), and the couple honeymoon in Venice. They travel on to Walter's medical post in Shanghai, where he is stationed in a government lab studying infectious diseases. They find themselves ill-suited, with Kitty much more interested in parties and the social life of the British expatriates.
Kitty meets Charles Townsend (Liev Schreiber), a married British vice consul, and the two engage in a clandestine affair. When Walter discovers his wife's infidelity, he seeks to punish her by threatening to divorce her on the grounds of adultery, if she doesn't accompany him to a small village in a remote area of China. He has volunteered to treat victims of an unchecked cholera epidemic sweeping through the area. Kitty begs to be allowed to divorce him quietly, but he refuses, stating ""Why should I put myself through the smallest trouble for you?"" She hopes Townsend will leave his wife Dorothy and marry her. When she proposes this possibility to Charles, he declines to accept, despite earlier claiming to love Kitty.
She is compelled to travel to the mountainous inland region with her husband. They embark upon an arduous, two-week-long overland journey, which would be considerably faster and much easier if they traveled by river, but Walter is determined to make Kitty as unhappy and uncomfortable as possible. Upon their arrival in Mei-tan-fu, she is distressed to discover they will be living in near squalor, far removed from everyone except their cheerful neighbor Waddington, a British deputy commissioner living with a young Chinese woman in relative opulence.
Walter and Kitty barely speak to each other and, except for a cook and a Chinese soldier assigned to guard her, she is alone for long hours. After visiting an orphanage run by a group of French nuns, Kitty volunteers her services, and she is assigned to work in the music room.

When planted, the seed becomes a flower, and inside the flower is a little girl the size of an old woman's thumb. The old woman names the girl Thumbelina and raises her as her own. Although Thumbelina loves her mother, she longs for the company of someone her size. One night, Cornelius, the prince of the fairies, bumps into Thumbelina after hearing her beautiful song. The two ride on Cornelius's bumblebee and fall in love; During this walk, Mrs. Toad and her son Grundel are delighted with Thumbelina singing. Cornelius promises to return the next day, but after he's gone, Mrs. Toad kidnaps Thumbelina from her bed and takes her away. Thumbelina wakes up on Ms. Toad's show boat. Ms. Toad wants Thumbelina to join her group and marry Grundel, who has a crush on her. Thumbelina is left alone on a lily pad to go find a priest, but a friendly swallow, Jacquimo (the film's narrator), hears Thumbelina's cries for help and frees her. Jacquimo's friends, the jitterbugs, promise to help Thumbelina get home safely while Jacquimo sets off to find Cornelius. Meanwhile, Cornelius finds out about Thumbelina's kidnapping and ventures out to find her. While trying to get home, Thumbelina is ambushed by the Berkeley Beetle, who scares the jitterbugs. He is in love with her singing and promises to show her the way home if she sings at her Beetle Ball first. Thumbelina agrees, but when she is badly received at the Beetle Ball, Beetle kicks her out without helping her. Winter is coming. Jacquimo accidentally impales his wing with a thorn and is struck by the cold, while Cornelius falls into a lake and freezes in ice. Grundel, who is looking for Thumbelina, finds Beetle and discovers that she is in love with Prince Cornelius and, after being convinced by Beetle, decides to find and kidnap Cornelius to lure Thumbelina to him. Grundel forces Beetle to help him while Grundel steals his wings and will not return them until Beetle has found and captured Cornelius. Thumbelina is taken in by Miss Fieldmouse, who tells her that Cornelius is dead. The two visit Miss Fieldmouse's neighbor, Mr. Mole, who tells them about a dead bird he found in his tunnel earlier that day. It turns out to be Jacquimo, whom Thumbelina discovers is just unconscious. Mr. Mole wishes to marry Thumbelina; Heartbroken by Cornelius's death, Thumbelina agrees. Jacquimo wakes up under Thumbelina's care and goes to find Cornelius, refusing to believe that he is dead. Meanwhile, Beetle brings Cornelius's frozen body to Grundel and informs him that Thumbelina will marry Mole. After the two leave to stop the wedding, the young jitterbugs unfreeze Cornelius's body. At the wedding, Thumbelina realizes at the last moment that she cannot marry someone she does not love and refuses to take vows. Grundel and Beetle break up the wedding, but Thumbelina runs away from them and Mr. Mole. Cornelius intercepts the crowd and confronts Grundel, the resulting fight causing both of them to fall into an abyss. Once out and free, Thumbelina reunites with Jacquimo, who takes her to Cornelius' kingdom, the Valley of the Fairies. Cornelius"

The police must investigate a series of robberies along a strip of land in the city. The new mayor of the city (Kenneth Mars) assigns Captain Harris (G.W. Bailey) and Lt. Proctor (Lance Kinsey) to the case, but while on stakeout the Wilson gang manages to slip through their fingers.The Mayor wants Harris and Proctor to work with Police Academy head Commandant Lassard (George Gaynes) on apprehending the gang. Lassard assembles a seven-man team consisting of Hightower (Bubba Smith), Tackleberry (David Graf), Jones (Michael Winslow), Hooks (Marion Ramsey), Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), Fackler (Bruce Mahler), and Lassard's nephew, Nick (Matt McCoy) who transfers from Miami (in the previous film Police Acdemy 5) to the city to remain close to his friends and dull-witted uncle.After distributing flyers as to the information of the Wilson gang and getting nowhere, Nick McCoy stumbles upon a paper heading of an antique diamond heading to a museum, and gets an idea to use it as bait: however the robbers nab the diamond anyway by cutting a hole in the truck and escaping through the sewer system. McCoy then decides to go undercover to get information regarding a possible hideout, but Harris decides to go undercover to get a confession.It turns out that Harris goes undercover as a window washer at a tall building, for which he has a fear of heights, and gets a confession of himself on tape after his loyal but numb-skull lacky, Proctor, accidentally knocks him over the balcony.It is revealed here that the robberies are committed by a group of three dim-witted criminals who do not seem to be able to do this on their own, and it is revealed they are being guided by a literally shadow figure known as the ""Mastermind"", who speaks to the three behind a wall of glass and uses a voice distortion device. He devises a plan to get the cops out of the way.Commandant Lassard and his men are later suspended after stolen jewellery from the last robbery is planted in Lassard's locker, pending an investigation. The misfit cops decide to clear Lassard's name by nabbing the gang and the ringleader. Accessing data files from a computer, McCoy deduces that the robberies are occurring along a bus route, thus intentionally lowering property values"

As war threatens to tear the country apart, a stone and an anvil appear from the sky over the city of London, with a sword firmly planted in the anvil. On the hilt of the sword read the words: ""Whoever draws this sword from this stone and from this anvil is a sane king, born of England."" Many try to draw the sword, but none can move it. In time, the sword is forgotten, and the Dark Ages plunge the countryside into dire straits. One day, in the woods, Sir Kaye goes hunting with his adopted brother Arthur, whom everyone calls ""wart"". After preventing Kaye from shooting a deer, Arthur promises to get the arrow back. Arthur's journey leads him to a small hut, where a wizard named Merlin resides and his pet owl, Archimedes, who can talk. Merlin explains to Arthur that he expected him to appear. After having tea, Merlin decides to accompany Arthur home, and after packing everything in the hut in a small satchel, the two leave. Arthur and Merlin arrive at Sir Ector's castle, where Arthur is immediately put to work in the kitchen. Merlin introduces himself to Ector and shows his powers to the doubting knight. After some persuasion, Ector allows Merlin to stay, placing him in the Northwest Tower, a ruined building in the castle. A few days later, Archimedes observes the arrival of Sir Pelinore, who has brought news from London of a jousting tournament to Ector and Kaye. According to the rules, the winner of the tournament will become the new King of England. Ector eagerly begins to train Kaye, and in his excitement, promises Arthur that if he continues to work hard at his homework, he can become Kaye's squire. Merlin hears about this news and decides to push Arthur to see his true potential (as Merlin can move into the past and the future, he knows who Arthur will become). While walking outside along the castle moat, Merlin explains that he can turn into a fish. This idea turns Arthur on, and Merline turns them both into fish, to explore the moat. However, a much larger fish soon gives chase to young Arthur, until they both manage to escape. Arthur's delay in helping Kaye train causes him to wash the dishes. Merlin"

When planted, the seed grows into a flower and inside the flower is a little girl as big as the old woman's thumb. The old woman calls the girl Thumbelina and raises her as her own. Although Thumbelina loves her mother, she longs for company of someone of her own size. One evening Cornelius, the fairytale prince, comes upon Thumbelina after hearing her beautiful song. The two ride on Cornelius' bumblebee and fall in love; During this ride, Mrs. Toad and her son Grundel are enchanted by the singing of Thumbelina. Cornelius promises to return the next day, but after he leaves, Mrs. Toumbelina kidnaps her from her bed and takes her away. Thumbelina wakes up on Mrs. Toad's display boat. Mrs Toad wants Thumbelina to join their group and marry Grundel, who is in love with her. They leave Thumbelina alone on a lily pad to fetch a priest, but a friendly swallow, Jacquimo (the narrator of the film), hears Thumbelina's cries for help and frees her. Jacquimo's friends, the jitterbugs, promise to help Thumbelina get home safely while Jacquimo leaves to track down Cornelius. Meanwhile, Cornelius learns of Thumbelina's abduction and dares to find her. While trying to get home, Thumbelina is led into a trap by Berkeley Beetle, who scares away the jitter bugs. He is delighted with her singing and promises to show her the way home once she sings on his Beetle Ball. Thumbelina agrees, but if she is badly received at the Beetle Ball, Beetle kicks her out without helping her. Winter is approaching. Jacquimo accidentally drops his wing on a thorn and is knocked out by the cold, while Cornelius falls into a lake and is frozen in ice. Grundel, who is looking for Thumbelina, finds Beetle and discovers that she is in love with Prince Cornelius and decides to find and kidnap Cornelius to lure Thumbelina to him. Grundel forces Beetle to help him because Grundel steals his wings and will not return them until Beetle has found and captured Cornelius. Thumbelina is picked up by Miss Fieldmouse, who tells her that Cornelius is deceased. The two visit Miss Fieldmouse's neighbor, Mr. Mole, which tells them about a dead bird he found in his tunnel earlier in the day. It turns out to be Jacquimo, who discovers Thumbelina that he is just unconscious. Mr. Mole wants to marry Thumbelina; sad about Cornelius' death, Thumbelina accepts. Jacquimo wakes up under Thumbelina's care and leaves to find Cornelius, refusing to believe he's dead. Meanwhile, Beetle brings Cornelius' frozen body to Grundel and informs him that Thumbelina is going to marry the Mole. After the two leave to stop the wedding, the young jitterbugs thaw Cornelius' body. At the wedding, Thumbelina realizes at the last minute that she cannot marry someone she does not love and refuses to take the vows. Grundel and Beetle crashed the wedding, but Thumbelina fled for them and Mr. Mole. Cornelius intercepts the crowd and confronts Grundel, the ensuing battle that leads to them both falling into an abyss. After being outside and free, Thumbelina is reunited with Jacquimo, who takes her to Cornelius' kingdom, the Vale of the Fairies. Cornelius"

After looking in the shop windows, she walks home. Outside her apartment, she fends off Sid Arbuck (Claude Stroud), her appointment from the disastrous night before. Later, she is awakened by the new neighbor Paul Varjak (George Peppard) and rings her doorbell to enter the building. The couple chats as she dresses to leave after her weekly visit to Sally Tomato (Alan Reed), a master incarcerated in Sing Sing Prison. Tomato's lawyer, O'Shaughnessy, pays her $ 100 a week to deliver 'the weather report'. Audrey Hepburn as Holly Golightly
As she leaves for Sing Sing, Holly is introduced to Paul's 'decorator', the wealthy older woman Emily Eustace Failenson (Patricia Neal), whom Paul calls '2E'. That night, Holly goes out to the fire escape to avoid an overzealous date (Mel Blanc). She peeks into Paul's apartment and sees 2E money left behind and kissing Paul goodbye. After 2E leaves, Holly enters Paul's apartment and learns that he is a writer who has not had anything published since five years before. Holly in turn explains that she is trying to save money to support her brother Fred when he comes out of the military. The couple falls asleep, but wakes up when Holly has a nightmare about Fred. She later buys Paul a ribbon for the typewriter to apologize and invites him to a party at her apartment. There, Paul meets her Hollywood agent, O. J. Berman (Martin Balsam), who describes Holly's transformation of country girl into Manhattan social. He is also introduced to José Silva Pereira (José Luis de Vilallonga), a wealthy Brazilian politician, and Rusty Trawler (Stanley Adams), the 'ninth richest man in America under 50'. In the days that follow, Paul and Holly get closer. One day, 2E enters Paul's apartment, worried she's being followed. Paul tells her that he is going to investigate and eventually confronts Doc Golightly (Buddy Ebsen), Holly's estranged husband. Doc explains that Holly's real name is Lula Mae Barnes. They were married when she was 13"

In olden times, England is in turmoil. With the death of the King, noone can decide who is the rightful heir to the throne. With war threatening to tear the country asunder, a stone and anvil appear from the heavens in London town, with a sword planted firmly in the anvil. On the hilt of the sword, read the words, ""Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil is rightwise king, born of England."" Many try to pull the sword, but none can budge it. In time, the sword is forgotten, and the Dark Ages plunge the countryside into a dismal state.Out in the woods one day, Sir Kaye is out hunting with his adopted brother Arthur, whom everyone names 'Wart.' After causing Kaye to miss shooting a deer, Arthur promises to retrieve the arrow. Arthur's journey leads him to a small hut, wherein resides a sorcerer named Merlin, and his pet owl, Archimedes, who can talk. Merlin explains to Arthur that he was expecting him to appear. After they have tea, Merlin decides to accompany Arthur back to his home, and after packing up everything in the hut into a small satchel, the two set off.Arthur and Merlin arrive at the castle of Sir Ector, where Arthur is immediately put to work in the kitchen. Merlin introduces himself to Ector, and displays his powers to the doubting Knight. After some persuasion, Ector allows Merlin to stay, putting him up in the Northwest Tower, a crumbling edifice of the castle.A few days later, Archimedes observes the arrival of Sir Pelinore, who has brought news from London of a jousting tournament to Ector and Kaye. According to the rules, the winner of the tournament will become the new King of England. Ector eagerly begins to have Kaye train, and in his excitement, promises Arthur that if he keeps working hard at his duties, he can become Kaye's squire.Merlin hears of this news, and decides to push Arthur to see his true potential (as Merlin can move into the past and the future, he knows who Arthur will become). While walking outside along the castle's moat, Merlin explains that he can turn into a fish. This idea excites Arthur, and Merline turns them both into fish, to explore the moat. However, a much larger fish soon gives chase to young Arthur, until they both manage to escape.Arthur's tardiness in helping Kaye practice results in him washing dishes. Merlin finds him, and after bewitching the dishes and washing utensils, leads Arthur into the forest, where they both are turned into squirrels by the sorcerer. As Arthur leaps among the trees, he comes across a girl squirrel, who is soon madly infatuated with him. Merlin finds the whole scenario cute, until he is soon found irresistible by another squirrel. Merlin then changes himself and Arthur back to normal. The girl squirrel who was infatuated with Arthur, skitters away, heartbroken.Arthur and Merlin return to the castle, where Ector lectures Merlin for making Arthur shirk his duties. Arthur tries to defend Merlin, but his 'mouthing off' ends causes Ector to declare that Arthur will not become Kaye's squire, and that that honor will belong to another person of the castle, who is named Hobbes.Arthur is dejected at what has happened, but Merlin tries to get him to persevere, and plans to educate Arthur. As he attempts to explain things, Archimedes interjects on Merlin's teaching methods, as Merlin"

When they get out of the taxi they give the driver a generous tip, bribing him not to tell anyone about them. Alice and Judson check the exit sign for The Silver Queen, heading to Panama City, Panama, and they seem excited and anxious. Also waiting for the same flight is Peggy Nolan, who is delivered expensive flowers with a card thanking her for a favor. Peggy disdainfully tosses the card in the trash and hands the flowers to a woman who sells cheap gardenias. Soon after, the flight prepares to depart and we are introduced to the professor and Mrs. Spengler, an elderly couple, and Joe, the co-pilot of the flight, who is immediately attracted to Alice. Mrs. Spengler is a dominant woman, but her husband seems content to be commanded like a child. As they wait on the runway near the plane, a car arrives and a well-dressed man appears with a boy and another man. The boy is Tommy and he will be sent to ""Uncle"" Pete until his father, a mobster, can follow him later. As the passengers board, Bill, the pilot, receives word that an anarchist will be transported back to Panama"

When planted, the seed becomes a flower, and inside the flower is a little girl the size of an old woman's thumb. The old woman names the girl Thumbelina and raises her as her own. Although Thumbelina loves her mother, she longs for the company of someone her size. One night, Cornelius, the prince of the fairies, bumps into Thumbelina after hearing her beautiful song. The two ride on Cornelius's bumblebee and fall in love; During this walk, Mrs. Toad and her son Grundel are delighted with Thumbelina singing. Cornelius promises to return the next day, but after he's gone, Mrs. Toad kidnaps Thumbelina from her bed and takes her away. Thumbelina wakes up on Ms. Toad's show boat. Ms. Toad wants Thumbelina to join her group and marry Grundel, who has a crush on her. Thumbelina is left alone on a lily pad to go find a priest, but a friendly swallow, Jacquimo (the film's narrator), hears Thumbelina's cries for help and frees her. Jacquimo's friends, the jitterbugs, promise to help Thumbelina get home safely while Jacquimo sets off to find Cornelius. Meanwhile, Cornelius finds out about Thumbelina's kidnapping and ventures out to find her. While trying to get home, Thumbelina is ambushed by the Berkeley Beetle, who scares the jitterbugs. He is in love with her singing and promises to show her the way home if she sings at her Beetle Ball first. Thumbelina agrees, but when she is badly received at the Beetle Ball, Beetle kicks her out without helping her. Winter is coming. Jacquimo accidentally impales his wing with a thorn and is struck by the cold, while Cornelius falls into a lake and freezes in ice. Grundel, who is looking for Thumbelina, finds Beetle and discovers that she is in love with Prince Cornelius and, after being convinced by Beetle, decides to find and kidnap Cornelius to lure Thumbelina to him. Grundel forces Beetle to help him while Grundel steals his wings and will not return them until Beetle has found and captured Cornelius. Thumbelina is taken in by Miss Fieldmouse, who tells her that Cornelius is dead. The two visit Miss Fieldmouse's neighbor, Mr. Mole, who tells them about a dead bird he found in his tunnel earlier that day. It turns out to be Jacquimo, whom Thumbelina discovers is just unconscious. Mr. Mole wishes to marry Thumbelina; Heartbroken by Cornelius's death, Thumbelina agrees. Jacquimo wakes up under Thumbelina's care and goes to find Cornelius, refusing to believe that he is dead. Meanwhile, Beetle brings Cornelius's frozen body to Grundel and informs him that Thumbelina will marry Mole. After the two leave to stop the wedding, the young jitterbugs unfreeze Cornelius's body. At the wedding, Thumbelina realizes at the last moment that she cannot marry someone she does not love and refuses to take vows. Grundel and Beetle break up the wedding, but Thumbelina runs away from them and Mr. Mole. Cornelius intercepts the crowd and confronts Grundel, the resulting fight causing both of them to fall into an abyss. Once out and free, Thumbelina reunites with Jacquimo, who takes her to Cornelius"

Proctor (Lance Kinsey) to the case, but during the implantation, the Wilson gang manages to slip through their fingers. The mayor wants Harris and Proctor to work with Police Academy Commander Lassard (George Gaynes) to apprehend the gang.

Proctor (Lance Kinsey) on the case, but the Wilson gang manages to slip through their fingers. The mayor wants Harris and Proctor to work with Commander Lassard (George Gaynes), police chief, to apprehend the gang. Lassard puts together a team of seven men consisting of Hightower (Bubba Smith), Tackleberry (David Graf), Jones (Michael Winslow), Hooks (Marion Ramsey), Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), Fackler (Bruce Mahler) and Lassard's cousin, Nick (Matt McCoy) who leaves Miami (in the previous film Police Acdemy 5) for the city to stay close to his friends and dull uncle. After distributing flyers about the information of the Wilson gang and getting nowhere, Nick McCoy stumbles upon a piece of paper heading from an antique diamond heading to a museum, and gets an idea to use it as bait use: however, the robbers grab the diamond anyway by cutting a hole in the truck that escapes through the sewer system. McCoy then decides to go into secrets to get information about a possible hideout, but Harris decides to get a secret confession. It turns out that Harris is hiding as a window washer at a tall building, which he fears for heights, and gets a confession of himself on tape after his loyal but insensitive skull, Proctor, accidentally hits him across the balcony. . Here it is revealed that the robberies are committed by a group of three cunning criminals who apparently cannot do it on their own, and it is revealed that they are led by a literal shadow figure, known as the 'Mastermind'. ', talking to the three behind a glass wall and using a voice distortion device. He devises a plan to eliminate the police. Commandant Lassard and his men are later suspended after stolen jewelery from the last robbery was planted in Lassard's locker, pending an investigation. The police, who fit in incorrectly, decide to clear Lassard's name by pinning the gang and the main leader. With access to data files from a computer, McCoy deduces that the robberies are taking place along a bus route, thereby deliberately lowering property values in that part of the city. They also hear that someone has to 'leak' information"

When planted, the seed grows into a flower and inside the flower is a little girl as big as the old woman's thumb. The old woman calls the girl Thumbelina and raises her as her own. Although Thumbelina loves her mother, she longs for company of someone of her own size. One evening Cornelius, the fairytale prince, comes upon Thumbelina after hearing her beautiful song. The two ride on Cornelius' bumblebee and fall in love; During this ride, Mrs. Toad and her son Grundel are enchanted by the singing of Thumbelina. Cornelius promises to return the next day, but after he leaves, Mrs. Toumbelina kidnaps her from her bed and takes her away. Thumbelina wakes up on Mrs. Toad's display boat. Mrs Toad wants Thumbelina to join their group and marry Grundel, who is in love with her. They leave Thumbelina alone on a lily pad to fetch a priest, but a friendly swallow, Jacquimo (the narrator of the film), hears Thumbelina's cries for help and frees her. Jacquimo's friends, the jitterbugs, promise to help Thumbelina get home safely while Jacquimo leaves to track down Cornelius. Meanwhile, Cornelius learns of Thumbelina's abduction and dares to find her. While trying to get home, Thumbelina is led into a trap by Berkeley Beetle, who scares away the jitter bugs. He is delighted with her singing and promises to show her the way home once she sings on his Beetle Ball. Thumbelina agrees, but if she is badly received at the Beetle Ball, Beetle kicks her out without helping her. Winter is approaching. Jacquimo accidentally drops his wing on a thorn and is knocked out by the cold, while Cornelius falls into a lake and is frozen in ice. Grundel, who is looking for Thumbelina, finds Beetle and discovers that she is in love with Prince Cornelius and decides to find and kidnap Cornelius to lure Thumbelina to him. Grundel forces Beetle to help him because Grundel steals his wings and will not return them until Beetle has found and captured Cornelius.

Stella (Kiele Sanchez) has spent the last few months around the world trying to convince others that vampires exist in this world, riddled with grief over the death of her husband, bound by nightmares and empty of all emotions beyond hatred and sadness. While Stella constantly feels as if she is being hunted, she is well aware of the imminent threat to her life, and the death of her husband, Eben, which has deprived her of her ability to feel emotions and left her feeling cold and empty inside. . Following a mysterious man named Dane, she ends up in Los Angeles.
